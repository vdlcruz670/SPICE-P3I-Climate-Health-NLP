Whether and how much of the approximately 1/2 degree C of warming which occurred in the latter half of the 20th century is due to human industry has not been conclusively established.

"People concerned that manmade greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), may be causing dangerous climate change worry such a change may disrupt the hydrosphere, which comprises all of the water on Earth and in its atmosphere. This disruption, they argue, would lead to increased rainfall and erratic weather patterns that would greatly increase sea level and produce potentially devastating consequences.A report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an independent group of some 50 scientists from 15 countries, titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, summarizes a large body of research disputing these claims and finds the hydrosphere has exhibited only mild volatility over the past century in concert with natural climate cycles and with no correlation to human CO2 emissions.The data show short-term precipitation volatility is not correlated with either CO2 emissions or general climate warming. For example, monsoon intensity displayed no increase later in the century despite increased CO2 emissions, but instead was correlated with solar activity.In addition, monsoons were generally more intensive during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which runs directly contrary to the alarmist claims. On the other end of the volatility spectrum, CCR-II disputes the strength of the commonly cited connection between global warming and droughts, as evidenced by the similar rates of drought occurrence in the LIA and MWP.As with precipitation, CCR-II finds no significant connection between sea level or ocean temperature and human CO2 emissions. Sea level is determined by a multitude of factors, and CO2-induced global warming is a minor one. Ocean temperatures have remained virtually unchanged for nine years, according to data of the Argo buoy network.CCR-II found numerous problems with the consensus view of sea-level change. The global sea level has increased by an average of only 12 mm annually over the century, with a wide range of intra-year volatility between +5mm and -5mm away from the mean. Supposed instances of environmental harm caused by sea-level rises, such as coral reef destruction, are often the result of unaccounted alternative factors.Concern over manmade greenhouse gas emissions has been the impetus for many destructive public policies, including renewable portfolio standards, alternative energy subsidies, and high gasoline taxes. Yet, despite ever-increasing levels of CO2 emissions, scientists have been unable to demonstrate a connection to its alleged effects, such as hydrosphere alteration, over the previous century. CCR-II's findings demonstrate precipitation and ocean activity have little to no connection to human CO2 emissions. Therefore, energy production, the lifeblood of the global economy, should not be hindered by state intervention to reduce CO2 emissions.The above introduction was based on text from Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science and its Summary for Policymakers, published by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).The following documents provide additional information about the hydrosphere and oceans. Chapter 6 of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Chapter-6-Hydrosphere-Oceans.pdfIn Chapter Six of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, Willem de Lange and Robert M. Carter find little evidence for an overall increase in global precipitation during the twentieth century independent of natural multidecadal climate rhythms. Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdfThe IPCC claims to know, apparently with rising certainty over time, that ""most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations"" (IPCC AR4 SPM, p. 10). This Summary for Policymakers summarizes and interprets Climate Change Reconsidered II, a major scientific report that refutes this claim. More IPCC Misdirection: Its Dodgy Sea Level-Rise Assessmenthttp://www.cato.org/blog/more-ipcc-misdirection-its-dodgy-sea-level-rise-assessmentPatrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger of the Cato Institute criticize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's analysis of sea-level changes in a September 24, 2013 blog post. The authors point out the IPCC cherry-picks data clumps that coincide with their conclusions, while ignoring broader data that contradict them. For instance, the IPCC attributes the recent abnormally high increases in sea level to a new long-term trend, even though the rate of increase has already begun to decline to normal levels, thereby indicating this period was just another short-term cyclical increase. Precipitation Measurements and Trends in the Twentieth Century http://heartland.org/policy-documents/precipitation-measurements-and-trends-twentieth-centuryA research paper published in the International Journal of Climatology in 2002 presents the trends in precipitation over the last century. Global precipitation increased by only 9 mm per year over the century, despite enormous short-term volatility of up to 40mm. Short-term variability can be attributed to natural climate cycles, including reoccurring ENSOs, Arctic Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation. The authors admit global precipitation measurement is still primitive and not wholly reliable. Little Change in Global Drought Over the Past 60 Yearshttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/little-change-global-drought-over-past-60-yearsIn this paper published in 2012 in Nature, Justin Sheffield, Eric F. Wood, and Michael L. Roderick cast doubt on the supposed connection between global warming and the frequency of droughts over the past 60 years. The standard analysis used to estimate global moisture levels is highly flawed and underestimates moisture levels, they note. In reality, global moisture levels have barely changed, and by extension, theories that blame hydrosphere changes on global warming are also flawed. Research Explores Hidden Benefits of Intensive Rainfall in East Africahttp://phys.org/news/2012-11-explores-hidden-benefits-intensive-rainfall.htmlMaggie Clune looks at a new study published in 2012 in Nature Climate Change, which demonstrates some benefits of increased rainfall. Generally, climate scientists tend to focus on only the negative effects of climate change while ignoring the positive results it produces. One of these is that increased rainfall replenishes freshwater sources more often. This makes underwater aquifers, rivers, streams, etc. more bountiful, especially in technologically less-developed regions that are heavily dependent upon natural water sources, such as Central Africa. Indian Monsoon Variability in a Global Warming Scenariohttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/indian-monsoon-variability-global-warming-scenarioA paper published in 2003 in Natural Hazards applies to real historical data the IPCC's theory that global warming increases monsoon intensity. The researchers determined there is no correlation between monsoon intensity and global warming. Monsoon strength naturally oscillates along decade-long time intervals regardless of carbon production. Furthermore, increased global temperatures have no effect on intra-cycle variability.

"The most impressive thing about this summer's vaunted droughtcalled an ""ultra-drought"" by CBS icon Dan Ratheris that it wasn't one. Whereas Rather called this a ""summer to survive"" in the Midwest, it actually looked more like a summer to grow.Illinois experienced what is at least its third-wettest June (records go back to 1895). Toward the end of June, the entire state of Illinois, 90 percent of Missouri and Wisconsin, and half of Iowa were reporting unusually moist conditions. We think that qualifies as the ""Midwest.""But why should we be surprised by this spate of climate hyperbole? That kind of drought hype is about as repetitive as Vice President Al Gore saying ""risky."" Last summer, for example, we were bombarded with the same story, even though less of the country than normal was experiencing a significant moisture shortage. Both the ostensible drought and forecasts of more of the same were based upon the appearance of La Nia (unusually cold) conditions in the tropical Pacific.Going back just another year, recall the agricultural disasters predicted because of El Nio, the warm phase of this common Pacific oscillation. One major network featured brown cornstalks and a cloud of dust in August. That was in Texas, where corn is normally brown in August, given that it's planted early in the year. As for the dust, it was kicked up by a harvester plucking fat ears.The beating goes on and on. And what we find most interesting is that people continue to eat. Well and cheaply, we might add. What gives?Let's stipulate that supply and demand determine price. For food, the latter is increasing because there is a larger number of demanding mouths to feed. Everything else being equal, the price of food should increase slightly as a result of that. But adding in the effect of the 2000 drought, the 1999 drought, the 1998 drought, and so forth should be as calamitous as the Network News.In an attempt to verify all these terrible stories, we plotted out the price of corn in dollars per bushel, allowing for inflation. What is immediately obvious is that the price of corn is lower than it has ever been. Despite all the weather gloom and doom, as well as the population increase, the relative supply of the most important crop produced by the most important agricultural nation in history must be increasing.Our greener pals keep blaming us for the fact that Americans just don't seem to care about global warming. But perhaps they ought to look in the mirror. Constantly hawking weather disasters has a way of losing its credibility in the face of agricultural abundance.It is absurd to conflate warming with food shortages. The corn yield history was virtually steady for the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a dramatic rise in the second half. Today, one acre of land produces almost four times as much corn as it did 100 years ago.During that same time, U.S. temperatures varied considerably from year to year and decade to decade. Obviously, there is little if any correspondence between the nation's temperatures and its crop yields.What warming the United States has seen in the last three decades has been primarily in winter and, within that season, largely confined to the coldest air massesa prediction from greenhouse theory that the climate Cassandras rarely tout. A temperature change of this sort is beneficial for crops because it lengthens their growing season.Another benefit for crop production is the ever-increasing atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. We can certainly assert with confidence that the presence of additional carbon dioxide is responsible for about 10 percent of this abundant harvest.The evidence is in. Today's climate is a boon to agricultureno matter what you may hear on the evening news.ReferencesMichaels, P.J., et al., 2000. Observed warming in cold anticyclones.

"When confronted with the fiery question of where evidence lies of an impact that only occurred some 12,800 years ago, barely time for a deep breath geologically, the Younger Dryas Impact proponents respond with an extremely weak mumbling about air blasts, asteroid clusters and ice sheet impacts that left no evidence of a large chunk(s) of space debris hitting the Earth. They point out that the Tunguska Impact (called an impact even though it left no crater) was an air-blast at an altitude of 3-6 miles (5-10 km) above Siberia that yielded the equivalent of 3-30 megatons of TNT in explosive force. The skeptics counter with Meteor Crater in Arizona, a beautiful little 1,200 ft (4,000 m) diameter hole 570 ft (170 m) deep made by a meteorite a mere 54 yds (50 m) in diameter that released 10 megatons of energy upon impact. They reasonably expect that a piece or pieces of space debris able to spread ejecta over half of the northern hemisphere, cause a 1,300 year halt in global warming and lead to the extinction of numerous species that had survived for hundreds of thousands of years had to leave some evidence of its arrival behind. The YD proponents then countered with the fact that the northern half of North America was covered with ice sheets and an impact on a 1 to 2 mile thick layer of ice may have mitigated the expected formation of a crater.",0_0

"Now, the average of this system, the whole atmosphere and surface included together, is what should have the global average temperature of -18 degrees C, and it does, because the temperature goes from warm (+15 degrees C) at the bottom of the atmosphere, to cold (-70 degrees C) at the top of the atmosphere, and measured from space it is -18 degrees C on average. The bottom of the atmosphere is warmest because that is where the Sun does the real-time physical heating in the first place. The temperature decreases with altitude because the heat dissipates outwards from the ground and cools down, and also because of the natural adiabatic gradient. The amount of water vapour in the air-column reduces the adiabatic gradient and it also reduces night-time cooling, because of latent heat which is trapped and then released by the H2O molecules. -And to be sure, those H2O molecules wouldnt be able to get into the air-column if sunshine was freezing cold at -18 degrees C!- Finally, the natural existence of the adiabatic gradient (that is, the fact that the air has to cool with altitude), means that the bottom of the atmosphere must be warmer than top and therefore the bottom must also be warmer than the average. If the average has to be -18 degrees C, then this average has to be found between the bottom (warmest) and the top (coldest), and the bottom will naturally be warmer than that average.

This has led many scientists to conclude global warming is under way, with the finger of blame usually pointed at man-made emissions of such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide.Now an international team of scientists, including researchers from the Met Office in Bracknell, Berkshire, United Kingdom, has found serious discrepancies in the temperature measurements, suggesting that the amount of global warming is much less than previously believed.Measuring water, not airThe concern focuses on the temperature of the atmosphere over the oceans, which cover almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface. While scientists use standard weather station instruments to detect warming on land, they have been forced to rely on the crews of ships to make measurements over the vast ocean regions.Crews have taken the temperature by dipping buckets into the sea or using water flowing into the engine intakes. Scientists have assumed there is a simple link between the temperature of seawater and that of the air above it.However, after analyzing years of data from scientific buoys in the Pacific that measure sea and air temperatures simultaneously, the team has found no evidence of a simple link. Instead, the seawater measurements have exaggerated the amount of global warming over the seas, with the real temperature having risen less than half as fast during the 1970s than the standard measurements suggest.Reporting their findings in the influential journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists say the exact cause of the discrepancy is not known. One possibility is that the atmosphere responded faster than the sea to cooling events such as volcanic eruptions.A big cutThe findings have major implications for the climate change debate because sea temperature measurements are a key part of global warming calculations. According to the team, replacing the standard seawater data with the appropriate air data produces a big cut in the overall global warming rate during the last 20 years, from around 0.18C per decade to 0.13C.This suggests that the widely quoted global warming figure used to persuade governments to take action on greenhouse gas emissions exaggerates the true warming rate by almost 40 percent. The team is now calling for climate experts to switch from seawater data to sea-air temperature measurements.One member of the team, David Parker, of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the Met Office, said the discovery of the discrepancy ""shows we don't understand everything, and that we need better observations--all branches of science are like that."" Yet according to Parker, the new results do not undermine the case for global warming: ""It is raising questions about the interpretation of the sea-surface data.""Even so, the findings will be seized on by skeptics as more evidence that scientists have little idea about the current rate of global warming, let alone its future rate. Climate experts are still trying to explain why satellites measuring the temperature of the Earth have detected little sign of global warming, despite taking measurements during supposedly the warmest period on record.Some researchers suspect the fault may again lie with the ground-based temperature measurements. They say many of the data come from stations surrounded by growing urban sprawl, whose warmth could give a misleading figure. A study of data taken around Vienna, Austria, between 1951 and 1996 found that the air temperature rose by anything from zero to 0.6C, depending on precisely where the measurements were made.Robert Matthews is a staff reporter for the UK Telegraph, with whose permission this article is reprinted.",5_1

"11. This is especially disappointing. Based on the above, the authors appear to have gotten little at all out of their reading of Mann et al (2005).

Moreover, what can the authors possibly mean by ""non-sense"" predictors if not predictors that are composed entirely or almost entirely of noise. At SNR=0.25, for which Mann et al (2005) show a skillful reconstruction is still produced, the pseudoproxies are composed of 94% noise by variance.

Mann et al (2006) show that the performance for a fixed SNR=0.4 (86% noise by variance) are very similiar that for a multiproxy data set with the same average SNR (0.4), but for which the SNR for individual pseudoproxies ranges from SNR=0.1 to SNR=0.7.

"A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly. Both heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains, more than one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week. They are remembered to have been formerly frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me the earth used to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now. This change has produced an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the spring of the year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741 to 1769, an interval of twenty-eight years, there was no instance of fruit killed by the frost in the neighbourhood of Monticello. An intense cold, produced by constant snows, kept the buds locked up till the sun could obtain, in the spring of the year, so fixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect the buds, during their developement, from every danger of returning cold. The accumulated snows of the winter remaining to be dissolved all together in the spring, produced those overflowings of our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now.",0_0

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released an interesting (if somewhat dry and lengthy) report, World Energy Outlook Special Report 2016; Energy and Air Pollution. I recently discussed the report on an every-other-Monday debate I participate in on CBC's flagship business program The Exchange. As I mentioned in that discussion, I welcome this report, as it directs the world's attention to what I believe, and have always believed, is a huge source of human suffering and environmental degradation.Conventional air pollution (soot, acidic chemicals, ozone) on the scale seen in developing countries causes massive suffering, sickness and death.Fixing that should be a global priority.Yet we have, in recent years, been so focused on climate change impacts in the distant future, that we have lost focus on the reality that conventional pollution is killing millions of people today. According to the IEA, 6.5 million premature deaths every year are attributable to air pollution. The new IEA report makes it fairly clear that where we really need to focus, especially in developing countries, is on conventional pollutants: particulate matter, ozone-forming chemicals and acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide, with greenhouse-gas reductions being seen as a co-benefit.Another welcome aspect of this report is that it seems pragmatic, shying away from revolutionary ""all renewables"" language, and simply talking about moving to energy production that is less polluting, which realistically speaking involves natural gas, nuclear and hydro power. It also involves some very low-hanging fruit such as installing catalytic converters in vehicles, installing bag-houses and scrubbers on power plants, and switching from coal to natural gas, hydro and nuclear power generation.The report also emphasizes the importance of universal electricity access, and universal access to clean cooking fuels, which are crucial elements of human and environmental protection and empowerment.Of course, as with all things, one has to balance many factors, including the economic. As the IEA report notes, we know how to control conventional air pollution, but it's not without costs. And given that poverty is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality (probably the largest cause). So, phasing in air protections without breaking the economic engines of development is important.And there are always things to quibble about in a report like this. It's fair to ask how mortality is estimated, how benefit-cost analysis is done, when developed countries (like Canada) hit diminishing returns on additional air pollution measures, and all that. But pollution levels are so high in countries like China and India, one doesn't really have to ask whether reducing the pollution levels they experience is worth its costit most likely is.Still, warts and all, it's great to see at least some of our environmental debate return to what is probably the world's greatest environmental challenge: getting clean air to the billions who suffer without it. The IEA is to be complimented on its timely new report, and its restoring conventional air pollution control to its proper place in international policy.",0_0

(random) variability (processes such as El Nio/La Nia, volcanic eruptions, solar variability?note that not all models include all of these processes throughout the entire 1979-2010 period of study). As the time period over which the temperature trend is calculated increases, the impact of natural variability on the magnitude (and even the sign) of the trend decreases as the short-term temperature deviations caused by random variability tend to cancel out.",0_0

The data here mirror instrumental climate records from Fennoscandia for example, which also show over the last 250 years positive temperature trends and increasing early summer Siberian temperature reconstructions.

(ii) Superimposed on this systematic and continuous expansion, there is a pulse-like variation in local SST conditions in the Midriff, which seems to drive nesting pairs to emigrate toward California when surface seawater in the Midriff is too warm , the thermocline is too deep, and fish availability is poor. (iii) The decision by seabirds to abandon their traditional nesting grounds in the Midriff is compounded by the fishing effort during the previous season, which further increases the proportion of Elegant Terns migrating away from the Gulf of California.",0_0

Bearing acres are estimated at 28.0 thousand. California experienced an adequate number of chilling hours, thus benefiting the Freestone crop. Freezing temperatures hit California in early March, which resulted in frost damage in some areas. Frost damage, along with a decrease in the bearing acres, have resulted in a forecasted lower production for the 2009 crop. How is America going to end? We could be crushed by a climate strongman. - By Josh Levin - Slate Magazine Even if America sells its soul to keep everyone else out, the country will have to contract.

"Chicago--July 22, 2004: Yesterday, the debate over climate change reached a new low as attorneys general in eight states--all Democrats but one--and the corporation counsel for New York City sued five electric utilities for their alleged role in causing ""global warming.""The lawsuit is frivolous. Evidence of a human role in climate change is slim and constantly being challenged in scholarly journals. There has been no warming trend in the U.S. or in any of the eight states participating in the lawsuit.There is no evidence of any harm caused by whatever ""global warming"" may have occurred (according to some temperature measures) during the past century. Most of that warming has taken place in the coldest areas of the planet and at night, creating a more benign environment for plant and animal life. The best estimates of the net economic impact of the warming predicted by computer models show a small benefit--thanks to lower prices for energy, forestry products, and food--and unequivocal benefits to human health and longevity.For all these reasons, forcing five electric utilities to lower their greenhouse gas emissions would not affect global temperatures or weather in the U.S., and so would not provide any benefit or relief to the plaintiffs.Why, if this is the case, has this suit been filed? Chris Horner in a statement released by the Competitive Enterprise Institute says, ""This is grandstanding, pure and simple. That many of these officials are involved in one way or another in John Kerry's campaign also provides the whiff of a political favor being provided to the Democratic contender, gaining headlines for an issue with which the Bush administration is clearly uncomfortable.""NCPA Senior Fellow H. Sterling Burnett notes that many of the states involved in the suit have already increased their energy costs by adopting alternative energy mandates and conservation mandates, making their states less attractive to new business investment than other states. ""This is merely an attempt to level the economic playing field by forcing the rest of the nation to adopt their high-cost energy mandates,"" says Burnett.Finally, one wonders if this isn't one more desperation ploy by the beleaguered global warming alarmists, who in recent years have lost the political debate over Kyoto and McCain-Lieberman, the scientific debate in the leading academic journals, and according to polls, the support of the American public as well. Maybe by taking the issue to the courts, they can get lucky and find a jury willing to ignore the data and punish some big corporations?

Breaking: CO2 allegedly causing Yellowstone grizzly population to only expand 4 to 5 percent per year BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) Hunters are killing grizzly bears in record numbers around Yellowstone National Park and researchers say the once-endangered predator is expanding across the region . Bears are being seen and killed in places where they were absent for decades . Researchers suspect climate change is wiping out one of the bear's food sources and they worry the trend will continue as the animals roam farther in search of food. Yellowstone's 600 grizzlies were removed from the endangered species list in 2007 , following a recovery program that cost more than $20 million. If the death rate stays high for a second consecutive year, that would trigger a review of the bear's endangered status. ... Schwartz and other biologists who study grizzlies insist the population in the 15,000-square-mile Yellowstone region of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming remains strong for now, growing on average 4 to 5 percent a year. Yet they acknowledge climate change could prove the wild card that puts that growth in check. An epidemic of beetles in Yellowstone's high country has laid waste to tens of thousands of acres of whitebark pine trees, which have seeds that some grizzlies rely on as a dietary staple.",0_0

She also lifts the veil on the dark side of energy politics, where anti-energy extremists pull out all the stops to restrict energy production and consumers' energy use. Indeed, she slays the ""green"" monster that warps the thinking of some of the most intelligent people in politics, and she explains how government regulation and red tape have prevented access to so many of our vast natural resourcesNoon details how life would be with only electric cars and limited transportation, comparing it to the pre-1920s when Americans rode on horseback. Sure, there were no direct carbon dioxide emissions from transportation (other than horses' breathing), but each horse required five acres of hay and oats to feed it, and the horses left piles of manure on city streets which created great stench and spread disease. The unintended environmental and health impacts of conventional energy substitutes may have changed over the years, but they remain in one form or another, regardless of how environmental activists choose to frame the issue.Noon describes an environmental dystopia where the medicines that have helped double our life spans in the past century would be drastically curtailed by reduced availability of cheap energy.Noon understands and agrees that we all want a green earthclean air, fresh water, and a safe food supplybut restricting energy use and blocking technological progress are not good ways to achieve it. We have made huge environmental strides since the dawn of the industrial Revolution. Despite dramatic increases in population, economic production, electricity generation, transportation miles, etc., U.S. aggregate emissions are less than half of what they were just a few decades ago.When someone on a street corner or in front of a grocery store asks us to sign a petition to stop plans for a new power plant or some other natural resource project, we ought to remember the larger implications of the environmental utopia they seek, Noon notes.Unmasking Environmental ExtremistsShe pulls no punches in linking today's environmental zealots to the authoritarian leftists of the early and mid-twentieth century. Noon gives full documentation why many people correctly refer to today's environmental activist groups as ""watermelons""green on the outside, red (Communist) underneath. She quotes George Will explaining, ""today's green left is the old red revised.... The left exists to enlarge the state's supervision of life, narrowing the individual choices in the name of the collective good.""Noon provides support for her points with detailed case studies, such as the nefarious ways of the seemingly innocuous Humane Society. Noon gives readers all the information we need to find and read the detailed case studies ourselves, which is a huge plus.Noon also provides excellent information and data on the most dangerous environmental groups, such as their astonishing net worth. For example, the World Wildlife Fund, which is number three on the list, has a net worth of $426 million. Collectively, numbers two through 10 on the list are worth $2.6 trillion. The number one group on the list, the Nature Conservancy, is worth more than $5 trillion. Even groups ranking relatively low on the list have astonishing resources at their command. The number 7 group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, is worth $232 million. Number 8, Environmental Defense, is worth $145 million.Topics that Stand OutThe book does an excellent job slaying misconceptions on many energy-related topics, and a few deserve special praise. Noon emphatically and persuasively documents the farce of ""free"" solar energy. She meticulously explains the absurdity of burning crops to make ethanol and biofuels, documenting the vast amounts of land and resources required to divert our food supply into fuel.Providing context for energy-related environmental hoaxes, Noon succinctly conveys the deadly historical effects that followed the false DDT claims. She also documents the tragic economic toll on northwestern U.S. communities resulting from efforts to save the non-endangered spotted owl. Far greater economic costs are being imposed on the United States and western democracies in the name of fighting a nonexistent global warming problem.Energy Freedom is both a thorough book and an easy read. It will make a great Christmas stocking stuffer.",0_0

Paul and Anne Ehrlich's One with Nineveh employs the newly popular technique of drawing an analogy between the collapse of an ancient civilization due to environmental factors and the prospective collapse of modern civilization. The Ehrlichs look to Biblical Nineveh; last year Jared Diamond used the same technique with the ancient Mayan civilization in the pages of Harper's magazine. Declaring with certitude from the murky and incomplete history of Nineveh and Maya that environmental factors were the cause of their collapse and that their example is applicable to modern technological society is just the kind of superficial analysis that leads more and more disinterested observers to dismiss popular environmentalism as cranky obscurantism.,0_0

Wilson argues that tropical forests obey exactly the same rule as their size is reduced. By plugging into the formula the rate at which tropical forests are being cut down throughout the world Wilson puts it at 2 percent per year he obtains the figure of 50,000 species lost each year.

The statute has been hijacked by environmental activists in order to slow or prevent government agencies from taking actions the litigants do not like.

But in the area of life satisfaction, in which they report that ""people who become unemployed report lower life-evaluations, even after controlling for their lower income,"" we do not get a comparison of France with the United States; the former would do less well in this regard than on a health assessment.

"(Of course, Kerry is less of a nutcase. He ""just"" believes that Oswald was directed by the Soviets or Cubans. Well, I would say that a marine who defects to the Soviet Union is probably extreme enough to think of similar acts himself. Even if Kerry were right, I don't think it is an important change to the story. There were surely people in the USSR who would rather openly say that the U.S. president should have been killed along with many other ""imperialists"". And what? They couldn't do it. Oswald could. So even if he had met with some people who told him he should have, why does it matter? He was almost certainly a more unhinged commie than an average member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party so he was still likely to be the key guy behind the murder. Unlike Oswald, the top Soviet officials were sane enough to realize that a murder of JFK wouldn't end capitalism in America etc. so they were less motivated than him, too.)",0_0

Second, the economic growth rate assumed by the Bush study (2.3 percent a year for 1995 through 2010) was higher than the growth rate assumed by the Clinton study (2.1 percent for the same time period), and thus forecast a higher level of emissions.

"Radiation calculaions in global numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models are usually performed in 3-hourly time intervals in order to reduce the computational cost. This treatment can lead to an incorrect Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at the Earth's surface, which could be one of the error sources in modelled convection and precipitation. In order to improve the simulation of the diurnal cycle of GHI at the surface a fast scheme has been developed in this study and it can be used to determine the GHI at the Earth's surface more frequently with affordable costs. The scheme is divided into components for clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The clear-sky component has been described in part I. The cloudy-sky component is introduced in this paper. The scheme has been tested using observations obtained from three Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) stations established by the U. S. Department of Energy. The results show that a half hourly mean relative error of GHI under all-sky conditions is less than 7\%. An important application of the scheme is in global climate models. The radiation sampling error due to infrequent radiation calculations is investigated using the this scheme and ARM observations. It is found that these errors are very large, exceeding 800 W m -2 at many non-radiation time steps due to ignoring the effects of clouds. Use of the current scheme can reduce these errors to less than 50 W m -2",0_0

It is time to begin to subject regulations to the same type of controls to which expenditures have long been exposed.

"President Bush's EPA resisted listing carbon dioxide as an air pollutant on two grounds. The first was definitional. ""Air pollution"" is not defined in the statute, but under normal rules of construction it must mean something, and absent any other guidance the logical source of wisdom is a dictionary, which defines ""pollute"" as meaning ""to make . . . impure or unclean."" So a pollutant must be something that is not only emitted, but something that renders the air impure, which can hardly be said of carbon dioxide. Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent commented: ""It follows that everything airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an ""air pollutant.' This reading of the statute defies common sense."" Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) observes that any other interpretation also makes the ""precursor"" sentence redundant, because if everything emitted is an air pollutant, then precursors would be pollutants automatically. The Court brushed aside this perfectly conventional (and correct) argument from statutory interpretation, finding the statute ""unambiguous"" in its meaning that anything emitted is a pollutant. Since the EPA had already said that carbon dioxide contributes to climate change, which endangers public health and welfare, it had no choice but to put it on the regulatory agenda.",0_0

Only about 15% of structural engineers are women and 70% of those got to the field because of affirmative action (before this movement began to be intense 15 years ago, there were about 5% of women in that field), so there is clearly something suspicious going on here, if the first catastrophic testimony comes from such an unexpected source.",0_0

Haven't seen you since Bosnia . . .."" As the hours wore on, however, and I nervously doodled in my note pad, shifted in my chair, looked at my watch, and thought about all the real work I had to do that evening, I decided that, no, labeling them mafiosos or mercenaries was much too kind. They seemed more to be the progeny resulting from a mating between a mad oracle and a giant carrion-eater.

They leisurely take flight toward the smell of death; circle, and then swoop down, screeching UNintelligble nonsense.

Better nutrition, sanitation, and health care, for example, have reduced infant mortality in America from about 300 babies dying out of 1,000 live births in 1850, to about six today. More babies surviving lessened the need for multiple pregnancies, which in turn reduced family size.",0_0

In August 2010, Judge Jeffrey White revoked the USDA's approval of Roundup Ready sugar beets on similar grounds. Although Judge White permitted Roundup Ready beets then in the ground to be grown to maturity and harvested, his decision has sown monumental confusion because an estimated 95 percent of the sugar beets currently grown in the United States are of the Roundup Ready variety. With such intense demand for the genetically engineered variety, sugar beet breeders have cut back substantially on their production of conventional seeds, meaning that beet growers cannot easily switch back to conventional varieties because supplies of seed are inadequate. The commodity price of sugar shot up by 55 percent between August and November 2010, largely as a result of the court's decision.",0_0

The media event highlighted an investigation into ""whether fossil fuel companies misled investors and the public on the impact of climate change on their businesses."" We think this effort by our colleagues to police the global warming debate through the power of the subpoena is a grave mistake.We all understand the need for a healthy environment, but we represent a wide range of viewpoints regarding the extent to which man contributes to climate change and the costs and benefits of any proposed fix. Nevertheless, we agree on at least one thing this is not a question for the courts. Using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate undermines the trust invested in our offices and threatens free speech.We are concerned that our colleagues' investigation undermines the trust the people have invested in Attorneys General to investigate fraud. Investigatory subpoenas were issued to at least one company and one non-profit believed to have made statements minimizing the risks of climate change. At the press conference, one of our colleagues noted that ""e are pursuing this as we would any other fraud matter."" We routinely investigate fraud, and have done so with many of the states present at the press conference. But this investigation is far from routine.

"The Obama Administration announced on Thursday the final rules for new fuel economy standards. By 2016, passenger cars and light trucks (SUVs and pickups) will have to achieve an average of 35.5 miles per gallon. At 36 mpg, the two-seater Smart Car is one of the few current models that already surpasses the average required. These new rules are an amalgam of what Congress mandated in the 2007 anti-energy act and new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act derived from the Endangerment Finding. As my CEI colleague Marlo Lewis points out in a comprehensive analysis , the new fuel economy rules will trigger a regulatory cascade under the Clean Air Act.

"Where the foxes caper ... Tally ho! The recently elected mayor of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, has infuriated Britain's politically powerful homosexualist lobby by attempting to withhold local funding for this year's Gay Pride celebrations. The funding for this year's event in June went through, but Mayor Peter Davies, a member of the English Democrat party and the father of Tory MP Philip Davies, has scrapped all future funding for the annual Gay Pride event. ""I'm not a homophobe,"" he said, ""but I don't see why council taxpayers should pay to celebrate anyone's sexuality."" Davies is only the second mayor of Doncaster to have been elected directly by a popular vote rather than by council members. He campaigned on a popular platform, that has reportedly alarmed the political classes on both the Labour and Tory sides of the House, in which he pledged to ""stamp out political correctness"" in every area of Doncaster's local government. To accomplish this, Davies has recruited the group Campaign Against Political Correctness (CAPC) to consult on his planned reforms. A spokesman for the CAPC, John Midgley, said that ""people are crying out"" for an end to the wave of politically correct policies in Britain. ""We commissioned a survey by ICM,"" Midgley said, ""that said 80 per cent of people are fed up to the back teeth with it."" Davies promised to end council funding for ""politically correct initiatives"" and to ""scrap politically correct non-jobs"" such as ""community cohesion officers"" and ""encourage the former employees to seek meaningful employment."" In his first week in office, Davies fulfilled his promises by cutting his own salary from 73,000 to 30,000; reducing the number of councillors from 63 to 21, saving the town 800,000 a year. He immediately announced plans to reduce council tax by 3 per cent and got rid of the mayoral limousine. He ended a ""twinning"" arrangement with five towns around the world, which he described as ""just for people to fly off and have a binge at the council's expense.""

"New perils, then, but also new promises. The maritime dimension is an opportunity for European allies to go beyond the ""EU sandbox"" and play a global role at relatively little cost, if only because public opinion will always find a maritime commitment more palatable than a continental one. For many allies like Norway and Greece, a greater maritime commitment on the part of NATO would also be a way to display niche capabilities (it's not as if the U.S. Navy had a surplus of mine-sweepers) that they don't necessarily possess in land operations. Last but not least, for a country like France, a middle-sized power as a land power but a maritime superpower of sorts (the third largest EEZ in the world thanks to its South Pacific possessions), a greater maritime commitment would be a way to maintain a leadership position. When it comes to NATO, to be sure, France, since 1958, has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

"A coalition of environmental advocacy groups is pushing for the implementation of a federally financed environmentalist agenda in the curricula of all public schools.The benign-sounding No Child Left Inside Act, HB 3036, won U.S. House of Representatives approval on a 294-109 vote September 19, with only one Democrat (Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana) opposed and two ranking Republicans on the Education Committee (Reps. Howard McKeon of California and Michael Castle of Delaware) in support.Congress went into fall recess before the Senate acted on the measure, but the bill could be integrated with the No Child Left Behind reauthorization next year or attached to a spending bill in the post-election lame-duck session.Two dozen environmental groups, led by the Sierra Club and Chesapeake Bay Foundation, are lobbying for the measure, which would award grants for integrating environmentalist precepts into curricula, academic standards, and teacher preparation.The money could go not just to school districts but to the very nonprofit advocacy organizations working to pass the bill.Objectivity Voted DownBy a 230-172 vote, the House rejected an amendment proposed by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) that would have barred lobbying groups from receiving the grants and would have sought scientific accuracy and balance in what students were taught about the environment through the funded programs.The coalition's Web site, hosted by the Chesapeake Bay group, indicates the slant it would seek in classrooms by defining ""the problem"" as, among other things, climate change, childhood obesity, and something called ""nature-deficit disorder.""That is a term author Richard Louv coined in his book Last Child in the Woods, where he argued children are losing touch with the natural world and hence becoming vulnerable to maladies such as attention deficit disorder, depression, and obesity.The theory is an intriguing (if unproven) one, but should Washington take over from parents, churches, and community groups the task of taking kids out on hikes to commune with nature?Humans BlamedAs for climate change, the coalition asserts, ""the issue of global climate change requires Americans to understand the human-created challenges facing our world and the options facing our nation moving forward. It is projected that major societal change will be needed in response to global warming. To that end, each of us may be called upon to make changes to reduce the impact on the environment.""That statement assumes global warming is occurring as a result of the activities of man, and that drastic, mandatory changes in modern living will be necessary to curb it. Clearly, the federally funded curriculum would side with the forces led by former Vice President Al Gore falsely contending the science is settled on all this and no room exists for debate.If enacted, No Child Left Inside, the chief sponsor of which is Maryland Democrat Rep. John Sarbanes, would require state grant recipients to show how they were measuring ""student environmental literacy"" and instilling environmental know-how in teachers. Advocacy groups receiving grants would design their own evaluation and accountability plans.Important Story OverlookedIn a September 22 statement, EdWatch Action, a citizens group in Minnesota, called HB 3036 an ""unconstitutional expansion of the federal government into the realm of education that promotes unscientific, non-academic, politically correct environmental propaganda.""The environmental standards, curriculum, and programs funded by this bill that are to be put in every subject would take valuable time and resources from core academic issues,"" the group continued. ""The grants also promote programs that are supposed to teach bogus, subjective, and political concepts like self-esteem and environmental justice.""In an early autumn dominated by news of a mind-boggling $700 billion federal bailout of financial institutions, this effort to use federal power to mandate environmentalist indoctrination throughout the nation's classrooms received little ink or airtime.No Child Left Inside deserves a lot more attention in the context of the larger question of whether Americans should be able to choose the kinds of schools they want for their children or have to accept the standardized, politicized versions mandated by politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups.Robert Holland (rholland@heartland.org) is senior fellow for education policy with The Heartland Institute.",0_0

In a recent op-ed, Bolton says, ""we must ask whether the harm will be sufficient to dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Objectively, there is no reason to believe that it will."" Wolfowitz writes that ""normally, even the toughest sanctions would be unlikely to persuade Tehran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. . . . However, circumstances in Iran are no longer normal."" He argues that tough economic sanctions could be used, along with other forms of support, to push for regime change in Iran. He urges the United States to do ""what we can to support the forces of reform in Iran, both symbolically and practically. . . . That means the toughest possible sanctions, and soon. Time is running out."" Pletka says sanctions ""are not a silver bullet, and they may not deliver an end to the Iranian nuclear program."" On the Enterprise Blog, she recently suggested that the administration take ""French lessons"" from French president Nicholas Sarkozy, whose government has been out in front of the United States in urging a hard-edged approach to Iran.

"Now that Congress has passed thanks to the peeling off of a bare minimum of Senate Republicans and President Obama has signed a financial regulatory bill with a massive scope and untold costs, and a bill extending unemployment benefits without paying for them, he and the Democratic leadership have two more big items to rush through before Congress's August recess. They are a bill that will ostensibly help small business and the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan. While Congress is claiming it wants to help small business, confirming Kagan could mean great harm to business owners crippled by costly regulation. Based on her writings and her arguments as Obama's solicitor general (which is all we have to go on, since she has never served on the bench), not only is Kagan likely to rule against constitutional challenges to Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and other onerous laws, but she is also likely to do what she can to make it nearly impossible for smaller ""regulated firms,"" as she calls them, to have their day in court in the first place.",0_0

The NRA's ineffectuality could be demonstrated in a number of theoretical or technical ways, but Shlaes captures the futility of the enterprise in two magnificent sentences: ""In a period of a year, 10,000 pages of law had been created , a figure that one had to compare with the mere 2,735 pages that constituted federal statute law. In twelve months, the NRA had generated more paper than the entire legislative output of the federal government since 1789.""",0_0

Walker, who directs The New Coalition at The Heartland Institute. Frederick Douglass championed universal self-reliance and personal responsibility, Walker points out, and Booker T. Washington wrote, ""I have learned that success is to be measured, not so much by the position one has reached in life, as by the obstacles which have been overcome while trying to succeed.""In DemandWalker, a leading mainstream conservative black spokesman, is in high demand as a speaker who effectively and persuasively brings conservative and libertarian ideas to nonwhite audiences.On November 15 and 16, Walker addressed two town hall meetings on ""reparations"" for black Americans, hosted by the westside and southside locations of the Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago. Walker, who puts himself in the ""undecided"" column on this controversial issue, expressed his concern the issue will ""preoccupy too many of the best and brightest people of all races over an extended period of time,"" preventing them from focusing on more pressing issues such as education, black-on-black crime, and unemployment.Walker also spoke on behalf of maintaining the Rosenwald Apartments as a historic site on the National Register. The complex--a five-story walkup built in 1929 as the first middle-class housing project for blacks in Chicago--was built by Julius Rosenwald, a trustee of Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee school. Rosenwald said Washington's autobiography changed his life.On January 15, Walker will be the keynote speaker at birthday festivities for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the law school at Northwestern University. On April 26, he will address the annual convention of the Libertarian Party of Indiana. He is also scheduled to speak on National Public Radio in Chicago on a call-in show focused on racial and educational issues.New AdvisorsSince The New Coalition joined forces with Heartland in October 2002, the effort has attracted the support of scores of Americans from California to Virginia. Three new members have joined The New Coalition's advisory committee:Anthony Paul Andrews Ph.D., university professor of economics at Governors State University;Clarence S.

An evening cocktail reception cosponsored by Heartland and International Truck & Engine Corp. drew some 125 enthusiastic guests.On December 13, Bast addressed some 150 legislators--including 80 newly elected officials--during a summit session on education reform at the American Legislative Exchange Council's State and National Policy Summit held in Washington, DC. On the evening of the first day, Heartland once again cohosted a reception with International Truck & Engine Corp., this time attracting more than 100 guests. Saret staffed Heartland's exhibit throughout the event and reported strong interest in our publications.On November 14, Bast discussed free-market health care reform at the annual meeting of the Illinois Life Insurance Council in Oak Brook, Illinois. On November 20-21, Environment & Climate News Managing Editor James M. Taylor was in Houston, Texas to attend a conference organized by the American Petroleum Institute on voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His write-up of the conference appears in the January issue of ECN.On December 4, Bast participated in a day-long series of meetings in Washington, DC on health care reform with Bush administration officials and state-based think tank leaders. The meetings were scheduled by State Policy Network. Bast also attended Grover Norquist's weekly ""Wednesday Morning Meetings"" held at the offices of Americans for Tax Reform in DC. Copies of all three of Heartland's monthly newspapers are delivered to ATR for distribution at these important networking meetings.Current Heartland donors and members may request a free copy of ""Municipally Owned Broadband Networks: A Critical Evaluation"" by calling Cheryl Parker at 312/377-4000 or sending an email message to think@heartland.org. (Please put ""request for Broadband Study"" in the subject line.) The executive summary and full text of the study are also available on Heartland's Web site at www.heartland.org.NEW POLICY STUDY RELEASEDIn communities across the country, AT&T; and the Baby Bells have failed to deliver on promises they made a few years ago, at the height of the telecom bubble, to wire the entire country for broadband. Many communities think they can do the job themselves.Heartland Policy Study No. 100, ""Municipally Owned Broadband Networks: A Critical Evaluation,"" written by Heartland President Joseph Bast, warns the costs are higher and risks greater than taxpayers are being told. ""The real issue is not availability but price and who should pay it,"" writes Bast. A small number of heavy users of Internet services wants everyone else to subsidize access, even though this means spending millions of dollars building a system few people want or would voluntarily pay for.Copies of the Policy Study were mailed to local officials in Illinois known to be considering a municipal broadband system; members of the Illinois Commerce Commission and state legislators; daily newspapers in Illinois and key media outlets nationwide; members of Heartland's legislative advisory board; and donors, friends, and think-tank colleagues.Local media coverage of the study's release was extensive, with articles appearing in the Daily Herald (a northwest suburban chain with a daily circulation greater than 150,000); Northwest Herald (circ. 33,800); and three appearances in the Kane County Chronicle (circ. 14,000)--including an October 31 article that was the top page 1 story.ENVIRONMENT UPDATEJanuary 2003 issue of Environment & Climate NewsApproximately 30,000 copies of the January 2003 issue of Environment & Climate News were distributed to every state and national elected official in the U.S., environment reporters at daily newspapers, and thousands of grassroots activists across the country. The lead story on page 1 reports the November 2002 elections revealed voters are no longer swayed by the scare tactics and anti-business rhetoric of environmental advocacy groups.Feature articles by S. Fred Singer, Patrick J. Michaels, and Managing Editor James M. Taylor address new research on the declining threat of ""global warming."" Taylor describes several peer-reviewed articles suggesting temperatures are not rising as expected. Singer's report describes a new study on the role atmospheric soot particles may play in global warming, introducing a new element of uncertainty in climate models and shifting responsibility for curbing pollution to developing nations such as China and India.Another page 1 article reports the Bush administration's November 22 announcement to move ahead with reforms to the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Research published by Heartland in July (Heartland Policy Study #99) suggested such reforms are overdue.Beginning with the January 2003 issue, Heartland will mail three consecutive issues of Environment & Climate News to members of the George C. Marshall Institute. William Waggoner, an elected official from Selma, Oregon, distributes 200 copies of Environment & Climate News every month at meetings and conferences he attends. He met Publisher Nikki Saret at the National Grange event--he's a member of the Oregon state chapter--and now plans to distribute 150 copies of Health Care News as well!Public SpeakingAs reported in the President's Letter of this Heartlander, in November Dr. Jay Lehr spoke to a large and enthusiastic audience at the annual meeting of the National Grange.On December 3, Heartland's newest research associate, Jeff Trigg, attended a meeting of the Subcommittee on Cessation of the Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health. This government agency, created to coordinate the anti-tobacco efforts of various federal agencies, met in Chicago to discuss successful tactics to discourage smoking. Trigg, who was given the opportunity to testify, cautioned those present about the dangers to civil and economic liberties posed by using the coercive powers of the state to prevent conduct that is not harmful to others. His testimony can be found in The Smoker's Lounge on Heartland's Web site at www.heartland.org.On December 4-5, Heartland Director and long-time advisor Jim Johnston participated in hearings in Chicago organized by the Department of Energy on proposals to improve methods for measuring carbon dioxide emissions in anticipation of creating a ""cap-and-trade"" program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Johnston reports there was considerable skepticism about the government's ability to establish and enforce rules sufficiently stable to allow businesses to invest in the tradeable credits.EDUCATION UPDATEDecember and January School Reform NewsDecember and January issues of School Reform News, Heartland's monthly newspaper for school reformers, were sent to approximately 45,000 readers, including state and national elected officials, journalists, grassroots activists, and teachers and principals at charter schools and private K-12 schools nationwide.The December 2002 issue features an exclusive interview with reformer, scholar, and educator Chester E. ""Checker"" Finn Jr. of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation. According to Finn, ""the standards and accountability strategy for education reform coexists and may even be co-dependent with the freedom and competition strategy. An awful lot of people sign up for one or the other, and actually come to regard the other one as an enemy. I've come to believe that the two approaches need each other.""The December issue also reports on a school choice conference held in Colorado and addresses such topics as teaching methods in successful high-poverty schools, charter schools, history teaching, and school district size.The January issue of School Reform News offers hard numbers, comprehensive tables, and useful graphs that document in several ways the need for effective school reform in the U.S. The issue's exclusive interview is with John D. Merrifield, an economics professor at the University of Texas-San Antonio and author of The School Choice Wars. Merrifield, who worries current voucher programs are too limited in scope to act as useful models, says ""We don't need school choice as a lifeboat; we need it as a reform catalyst. ... When we talk about duplicating escape hatch programs like Milwaukee or Cleveland or Florida, we're defining too limited a role for school choice in our reform efforts.""Media CoverageHeartland Chairman Herb Walberg, who calculates it costs $181,851 to produce a high school graduate in the District of Columbia public schools, was cited in a Sunday, November 24 article in the Washington Post, reaching a circulation of 808,884 readers! In case you're wondering, it costs more to produce a graduate from the DC public school system than the average cost in any of the 50 states, though some cities are even more inefficient with their funds: Cleveland ($297,282), Milwaukee ($234,886), and Columbus, Ohio ($197,080). Walberg's report, ""Hold Schools Accountable for Cost of Finished Graduate,"" appeared in the October 2002 issue of School Reform News.Heartland's thoughts on school choice also appeared in the October 23 issue of Education Week (circ. 60,000) in an article about Illinois' tuition tax credit measure. The story quoted School Reform News Managing Editor George A. Clowes.The Fall 2002 issue of American Outlook, published by the American Enterprise Institute, quotes from a July 2001 interview of William Bennett conducted by Clowes for School Reform News.Heartland President Joseph Bast's essay, ""Why Conservatives and Libertarians Should Support School Vouchers,"" appears in the Fall 2002 issue of The Independent Review, a journal of political economy published by The Independent Institute.On November 19, Bast discussed school reform and other topics for two hours with host Ron Newman on WBIG radio, broadcast from Aurora, Illinois.HEALTH CARE UPDATEDecember and January Health Care NewsThe December issue of Health Care News, Heartland's national outreach publication for market-based health care reform, was sent to approximately 20,000 elected officials, health care reporters, grassroots activists, and allies. The issue's cover story by Joe Moser documents voter support on November 5 for free-market health care reform. Managing Editor Conrad F. Meier offers a page 1 report on the stunning defeat of Oregon's closely watched single-payer initiative, Measure 23.The December issue also looks at the Bush administration's plan to limit the ability of the makers of innovative drugs to hold off early challenges to their patents, with Meier suggesting the President may have found a middle ground while Robert Goldberg calls the President's proposal ""patently absurd.""The January 2003 issue of Health Care News will be the first of three issues to be mailed, free of charge, to more than 18,000 members of the National Association of Health Underwriters. In exchange for a half-page ad and 600-word editorial, NAHU has agreed to share its membership list with Heartland.The January issue features page 1 coverage of state efforts to protect physicians from excessive jury verdicts and related malpractice insurance costs. Other stories describe the 108th Congress's health policy agenda--expected to include malpractice reform as well as prescription drug coverage, aid to the uninsured, and broad Medicare reform--and efforts by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick to strip away patent protection for America's pharmaceutical and biotech industries.Media CoverageHeartland's work on health care attracted unprecedented media coverage in the final months of 2002. Conrad Meier's observations on the defeat of Oregon's single-payer health care initiative appeared in the Wall Street Journal (circ. 1,752,639); Atlanta, Georgia Journal-Constitution (circ. 327,213); Raleigh, North Carolina News & Observer (circ. 161,604); Greensburg, Pennsylvania Sunday Tribune Review (circ. 142,23
); New Haven, Connecticut Register (circ. 128,328); Mesa, Arizona East Valley Tribune (circ. 115,000); Greensboro, North Carolina News & Record (circ. 91,458); Pueblo, Colorado Chieftain (circ. 51,205); Bloomington, Illinois Pantagraph (circ. 49,844); Scottsdale, Arizona Tribune (circ. 18,387); and the Web editions of the Spokane, Washington Spokesman-Review and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina Sun News. Meier also was cited favorably in an editorial in the Reading, Pennsylvania Eagle (Wednesday circ. 15,429).The Sunday, December 1 issue of the Columbia, Missouri Sunday Tribune (circ. 18,000) carried an op-ed by Meier on former Vice President Al Gore's recent endorsement of single-payer health care. It won't work, notes Meier, because ""public-sector failure, not market failure, lies at the root of today's problems. Promising more government intervention to solve a problem caused by government is, well, pretty dumb."" Meier's commentary was also picked by the Conservative News Service and distributed nationally.Heartland President Joseph Bast's article, ""Smallpox Vaccine Controversy Grows,"" published in the November 2002 issue of Health Care News, was distributed nationally by United Press International on November 1 and cited in a November 11 editorial in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin Journal Sentinel (circ. 266,590). That editorial subsequently was reprinted by the Victoria, Texas Advocate (circ. 42,285); Joliet, Illinois Herald-News (circ. 51,000); Elgin, Illinois Courier-News (circ. 33,240); Naperville, Illinois Lisle-Sun (circ. 13,000); Jasper, Alabama Daily Mountain Eagle (circ. 8,021); and Fort Morgan, Colorado Times (circ. 4,800). It also appeared on the Web sites of CNN Money and Black Enterprise Magazine.INTELLECTUAL AMMUNITIONNovember/December IAIntellectual Ammunition, published by The Heartland Institute since 1991, is the only public policy magazine with a free-market perspective delivered to every state and national elected official in the U.S. It is free to $49 Heartland members.The November/December issue includes a directory with complete contact information for more than 150 free-market think tanks and advocacy groups. It also features one-page columns written by experts on the staffs of such leading think tanks as Reason Foundation, PERC, and the Tax Foundation. The cover article, by Heartland President Joe Bast, describes how ""lax judges, poorly informed juries, and greedy lawyers have turned asbestos litigation into a giant game of chance that has little to do with either science or justice.""After 11 years of more-or-less bimonthly publication, Intellectual Ammunition will become a quarterly magazine in 2003. Although the magazine is the most popular Heartland product among state legislators, donors have been less willing to fund the multi-issue magazine than our issue-specific products. The first quarterly issue, Winter 2003, will be released in JanuaryCOMING UPHeartland Senior Fellows Jay Lehr Ph.D. and Wendell Cox are scheduled to speak at 15 events in the coming months. Use the table on this page to see if you can attend one of these events, or call Heartland Public Affairs Director Greg Lackner at 312/377-4000 to help plan additional meetings or events that take advantage of this schedule.Upcoming Senior Fellows Speaking EventsSpeakerTopicHostDatesLocationFor more informationJay LehrAgriculture & The EnvironmentLouisiana Agriculture Association Annual MeetingJanuary 15 2003Lafayette LouisianaGermaine Paige318/442-0971Jay LehrRecyclingAssociated Recyclers of WisconsinJanuary 17 2003Lake Delton WisconsinTerry Mesch715/672-5709Jay LehrAgriculture & The EnvironmentManitoba Agriculture & Food Association""Beef & Forage Week""January 20-23 2003(5 events)Winnipeg Manitoba CanadaMelinda German204/945-5402Jay LehrAgriculture & The EnvironmentAGCare CanadaFebruary 11 2003Guelph Ontario CanadaDiana MacDonald519/837-1326Wendell CoxTransportationPreserving the American DreamFebruary 24-25 2003Washington DCRandal O'Toole541/297-6798Wendell CoxSprawl & Smart GrowthNational Association of Office & Industrial PropertiesJanuary 23 2003Raleigh North CarolinaGregg Sandreuter919/460-1062Wendell CoxTransportationStrategy Institute Transit SummitMarch 25 2003Toronto Ontario CanadaDavid Laird416/944-8833Wendell CoxUrban IssuesTRB Urban Street SymposiumJuly 30 2003Anaheim CaliforniaRichard Cunard202/334-2963Merrill MatthewsHealth InsuranceNaperville Chamber of CommerceFebruary 24 2003Naperville IllinoisMike SkarrLee WalkerMartin Luther King Jr.Northwestern University School of LawJanuary 15 2003Evanston IllinoisMargaret Hope Allenm-allen@law.northwestern.eduLee WalkerMulticultural Perspectives on Libertarian IdeasLibertarian Party of IndianaApril 26 2003LaPorte IndianaBrad Klopfenstein317/920-1994Lehr will debate a leading advocate of mandatory recycling programs at the annual meeting of the Associated Recyclers of Wisconsin (AROW) on January 17. The debate takes place at Lake Delton, Wisconsin, part of the popular Wisconsin Dells tourist area.The request for Heartland to participate in this debate was prompted by an op-ed by James Taylor, managing editor of Environment & Climate News, that noted the recent decline in big-city recycling operations and how this was an illustration of the economic pitfalls of mandatory recycling. The op-ed was printed in several newspapers around the country and came to the attention of the head of AROW, who was not pleased by Taylor's statements.Later in January, Lehr will visit Winnipeg, Canada to address a meeting of the Manitoba Agriculture & Food Association, part of a four-day whirlwind of events that includes meetings with civic leaders and local lawmakers. Only someone with the energy and enthusiasm of Jay Lehr would be up for this challenge, but he's looking forward to his visit. And all that activity will surely help keep him warm!Cox Battles Myths about ""Sprawl""Heartland Senior Fellow Wendell Cox, an expert on mass transit and so-called urban ""sprawl,"" has four speaking events booked so far for 2003. He is on the program for ""Preserving the American Dream,"" a conference for supporters of mobility and homeownership, taking place in Washington, DC on February 23-25. Heartland is a cosponsor, along with The Thoreau Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and several other organizations. Conference cosponsors promise the eventwill help you effectively oppose rail transit boondoggles, high-density urban zoning, restrictions on rural property rights, and other so-called smart-growth' policies. It may also lead to the creation of an American Dream Coalition that will promote free-market solutions to urban problems.The conference will take place at the Wyndham City Center Hotel in Washington, DC.

"Now are you going to hear me start yapping that an amazing flip like this over 1-2% of the globe is a sign of global cooling. Of course not since that is pure nonsense. However arguing a cooling trend may be starting because of the cold PDO, which can be seen here with the 3 year meter temperature trend FOR THE ENTIRE GLOBE is something that should be considered.",1_2
"Not only do these charts make it clear that CO2 emissions are not the Earth 's proverbial thermostat, as claimed by the anti-CO2 scientific community, but over the last 10 years the globe has actually been cooling at a trend of -0.5 C per century.",1_2
"Further, weve seen cold in South Africa and Australia / New Zealand as well. This is NOT just a local weather event. Its a regional cooling. That means it is likely to have global implications.",1_2
"According to the measured thermometer data, the hottest decade in the US was the 1930s followed by the 1940s and 1950s. Despite a hot 2012, the current decade only ranks #4.",1_7

"To find just the opposite of what the climate alarmists predict should be occurring as a consequence of the ongoing rise in the air's CO 2 concentration must be a real blow to them. And this is not the first such blow. We reported the similar results of another Antarctic sea ice study just a few months ago ( Recent Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice Extent ), as well the finding that Antarctica has cooled slightly over this period ( Recent Trends in Antarctic Surface Temperatures ). And this is supposed to be the place where global warming is first detected? We'll buy that, which means, of course, that it just ain't happening!",1_1
"If we look at the trend of all the extremes in the satellite era, we see a reduced trend in the 1980s, an increase after the 1998 El Nio, particularly due to cold extremes, then a reduction in extremes in the last ten years.",1_7
"As this accompanying chart obviously indicates, snow extent has actually increased over the short term (see 3-year average curve); and since the beginning of the dataset, winter snows have ranged within a narrow band.",1_1
"All three show a period of higher snow fall around the 1960s and early 1970s. However snowfall in the last decade or two is clearly not unusual when compared with the earlier record up to about 1960 and there appears to be no decreasing trend since 1980. The following chart, comparing actual snowfall amounts for the 1940s with the last decade, makes it all abundantly clear.",1_1
"So Ioverlaid the current data on the 1990 IPCC graph, and it turns out that ice coverage now is similar to 1974.",1_1
"First winter snow extent has been increasing, and four of the five greatest snow extents have been since the year 2000. Does Dr. Robinson have trouble understanding his own graph?",1_1
"But it is not the temperature which is rising there, it is the sea-ice extent. And it really doesn't look consistent with the Cowtan and Way global warming trend supposedly due to alleged warming in the polar regions.",1_1
"So we find that, adding the two poles together, this year there has been much more ice at the summer solstice than the 30-year mean. Therefore, much more sunlight has been reflected than usual, and not less as is implied.",1_1
"Yesterday I wrote about sea level rise, and attempts to measure ice loss in Antarctica via satellite. And again, it is very clear that the results of scientific work are being hijacked in an attempt to push a scary message at us. The analysis of gravimeter measurements start with guesses and inferences, and the result is presented with a huge margin of error, and amounts to less than 1% of the annual ice loss Antarctica experiences every year.",1_1
"The animation below flashes between 2006 and 2015. Unless there isanother summer with strong southerly winds like in 2007, theamount of thick multi-year ice will be back to 2006 levels in a year or two, as the ice age increases.",1_1
"Nothing could be further from the truth. The ice cover in the Antarctic has recently reached a new all-(recorded)-time extent and the ice cover in the Arctic appears to be on a similar path. No wonder as the frost-free days in the Arctic, above 80 N have been fewer in the last two summers and the last winter in North America was brutally cold and long.",1_1
"And if that explanation were not confusing enough, the link at the end of the paragraph is to a 2009 New Scientist article about a paper by Turner et al that has a completely different explanation for the rise in sea ice:",1_1
"The oceans sea ice levels were 44.6% higher than the 1981-2010 average, breaking a previous record set in 2008 by 220,000 square miles.",1_1

"Bild reports that the vessel was on a 5-week expedition to repeat the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier. Ironically, rather than finding warming and open seas, the current expedition has wound up getting trapped by thick sea ice and blizzards that have yet to be penetrated even by modern ice breakers.",1_1
2010 average ice thickness is approximately the same as 2006 and 2007. It is higher than rotten ice 2008 and 2009.,1_1

The Antarctic sea ice extent has been at or near record extent in the past few summers; the Arctic has rebounded in recent years since the low point in 2007; polar bears are thriving; the sea level is not showing acceleration and is actually dropping; cholera and malaria are failing to follow global warming predictions; Mount Kilimanjaro-melt fears are being made a mockery by gains in snow cover; global temperatures have been holding steady for a decade or more as many scientists are predicting global cooling is ahead; deaths because of extreme weather are radically declining; global tropical cyclone activity is near historic lows; the frequency of major U.S. hurricanes has declined; the oceans are missing their predicted heat content; big tornadoes have dramatically declined since the 1970s; droughts are neither historically unusual nor caused by mankind; there is no evidence we are currently having unusual weather; scandals continue to rock the climate fear movement; the Uni,1_1
"I wrote about an SPPI report on historical temperature trends in the Antarctic a few days ago. The report summarised several studies that all concluded that temperatures across most of Antarctica had been falling since the mid 20thC, with the exception of the Antarctic Peninsula.",1_1
"In the words of the authors, ""continually increasing sea ice extent over the Antarctic Southern Polar Ocean, along with the observed decreasing trends in Antarctic ice surface temperature ( Comiso, 2000 ) over the last two decades, is paradoxical in the global warming scenario resulting from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."" Indeed, it would appear to be a major contradiction of that scenario. References",1_1
"During 2003 to 2008, the mass gain of the Antarctic ice sheet from snow accumulation exceeded the mass loss from ice discharge by 49 Gt/yr (2.5% of input), as derived from ICESat laser measurements of elevation change.",1_1
"More to the point, 2007 happened also to be the time of maximum historic sea ice in Antarctica . (There are many credible sources of this information, such as the following website maintained by the University of Illinois-Urbana: http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.anom.south.jpg ). Why, I ask, has Mr. Gore not chosen to mention the record growth of sea ice around Antarctica? If the record melting in the Arctic is significant, then the record sea ice growth around Antarctica is, too, I say. If one is insignificant, then the other one is, too.",1_1
"The models roughly describe the shrinking extent of Arctic sea ice observed over the past two decades, but they fail to describe the comparable growth of Antarctic sea ice, which is now at a record high.",1_1
"A paper published today in Earth & Planetary Science Letters evaluates snow and ice-mass changes in Antarctica using both satellite altimetry and gravimetry between 2003-2010. The data shows most areas of the ice sheet are stable to increasing in ice mass, including the East Antarctic ice sheet, which alone contains over 80% of the total ice mass of Antarctica. The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica, which overlie geothermal heat sources are found to be losing ice, but represent relatively small regions of the ice sheet. The entire Dronning Maud Land north coast of Antarctica was found to have increasing snow accumulation.",1_1

"The thickest ice is over the deepest part of a bedrock bowl 1000-2500 meters deep, e.g. at the NEEM site. It is not going anywhere anytime soon. That bowl interior is where the Greenland Sheet has been accumulating even as the edges sluff/melt. Creep decline becomes increasingly self-limited by underlying geology.",1_1

"Some temperature or ice differences are positive, some of them are negative, some of them are greater or smaller than other temperature or ice differences, there are lots of data. But what is important is that there's no evidence that something ""stunning"" is going on. There has clearly been some quasi-periodic behavior as well as noise in the Arctic sea ice evolution over the recent million of years and what we've observed in the recent 34 years is quite certainly ""rather representative"" of the behavior that has existed for a much longer time.",1_1
"???Well, 2013 is almost over,?? Newman points out. ???And contrary to the alarmist predictions by Gore and what critics refer to as his doomsday cult, the latest satellite data show that Arctic ice cover has actually expanded 50 percent over 2012 levels. In fact, during October, sea-ice levels grew at the fastest pace since records began in 1979.??",1_1
"There are claims coming from some communities that the Arctic sea ice is recovering, is getting thicker again, Mark Serreze, director of the Colorado-based centre, told Postmedia News on Wednesday.",1_1
"For instance, you could point out that data collected by The IARC-JAXA Information System clearly demonstrates that contrary to dire predictions of a complete melt, Arctic sea ice concentrations are now rising as they normally do.

"First we learned that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is actually helping us stave off the next inevitable ice age by a few years . Yes, you read that right: the runaway global warming scenario is now off the table; a new ice age is coming for sure , and whatever human warming effects there may be will only make our descent into the deep freeze a little more comfy.",1_2
"Latif made his cooling projections in 2008, and so are not that old (he predicted warm-winters backin 2000). And who can say that the cold winters arent related to his projections of cooling? Latifs projections look to be true, and likely will be truefor the new, current decade.",1_2

It is not my intent to argue that the global climate has been cooling since the late 1970s, but merely to present a case that there is no convincing evidence that it has been warming.",1_4

Working back in time, they came close to reaching a zero trend (no warming or cooling) for the period ending about January 1997, but they dont quite reach it. That means we have to go back another decade, to January 1987, until we can see the decadal trends reach zero again, but they dont drop appreciably below it.

"This makes what has happened in the past decade all the more remarkable. Because the greenhouse effect wants to force the temperature up which in the absence of a cooling influence is what would have happened, the fact that the temperature has remained constant indicates that whatever has been cooling the planet has had to increase in strength at precisely the same rate as the CO2 warming in order to keep the temperature a constant straight line.",1_4
"Prominent global warming alarmist James Hansen admits in a new paper that temperatures are not warming as fast as predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Hansen observes that carbon dioxide emissions are rising faster than IPCC forecasts, yet global temperatures are not following suit.

The extra tissue growth soaks up atmospheric carbon dioxide, which mitigates some of the IPCC??s expected warming.",5_2

Its the difference between record warming and no warming, the difference between our understanding and ignorance of the science. Say what you will about regional climate change, accumulating energy in the system, natural fluctuations, man-made aerosols etc, the temperature has to rise eventually.

"Focussing on the recent period in more detail, the onset of the current pause coincides with a maximum in upper ocean heat uptake around 2002, and may reflect a recovery both from Mount Pinatubo and from the record 1997/98 El Nio. A recent study (Guemas et al, 2013) shows that, in 2002, the upper ocean below the mixed layer took up heat, while the mixed layer and sea surface temperature did not warm. The onset of the pause may therefore have been caused by ocean processes, predominantly in the tropical Pacific, in which energy trapped by greenhouse gases was buried below the surface of the ocean.",1_4
"The new argument therefore is that the temperature has not risen over the last 10 years. This is indeed correct, both the GISTEMP series and the HadCRUT4 dataset in which missing areas have been interpolated by Cowtan & Way show a trend of 0.00 K/decade over 20052014.

The PDI is a product of three factors: storm frequency, duration, and intensity. In the past decade, typhoon intensity increased due to increases in ocean heat content. However, typhoon frequency and duration decreased due to stronger vertical wind shear and lower vorticity in the storm genesis region. The declines in frequency and duration overpowered the increase in intensity, producing a net decrease in PDI of approximately 35%.Based on climate modeling studies, Lin and Chan project that global warming will induce an additional 15% decrease in the Asia-Pacific PDI.

The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear.

The IPCC crew reminds us that Global average sea level in the last interglacial period (about 125,000 years ago) was likely 4 to 6 m higher than during the 20th century, mainly due to the retreat of polar ice.

In other words that the warming generated the CO2, rather than vice versa -- as happened in most of the Vostok ice core record from Antarctica. He points out that the rate of increase dropped sharply after Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and rose sharply after the very warm El Nino in 1998.

Moreover it is important to note that during both of the past temperature maxima of 1000 and 2000 years ago, the CO2 values were at 280 ppm while today they are at 400 ppm. This indicates that the earlier warmer periods likely were related to natural solar activity and not to a rise in CO2 because there was no CO2 rise during those warm phases.",2_1

"This paper discusses the effect of the greenhouse phenomenon and CO2 on global climate and suggests that numerical models that lack adequate knowledge of fundamental related factors cannot be used to extract ""sound"" conclusions. A very basic demonstration of this is done through a simple comparison between estimates of the forecast for global temperature increase obtained by various independent studies. Observing the global temperature and the CO2 atmospheric concentration though the geological aeons implies no obvious correlation. Physical observation on other planets like Mars and Venus, needing no numerical modeling, demonstrates the effect of the atmospheric-CO2 partial pressure on the temperature of the atmosphere. Moreover the CO2 role as a factor of danger or a benefactor for life is also addressed. On the other hand the role of the sun in the presently observed global warming has been greatly underestimated. Scientific evidence shows that the orbit of the earth and the Milankovitch cycles greatly affect the climate. A discussion follows pointing out the prime role that the sun should have on the earth's climate with regard to solar cycles' activity and irradiance, cosmic rays and cloud formation. The conclusion drawn here is that a natural signal of solar forcing has been mistakenly overlooked for an anthropogenic change, maybe owing to their quite similar effects on climate. For the moment science does not really have a complete and total understanding of the factors affecting the earth's complex climate system and therefore no sound conclusions can be drawn.",2_1

Diligent mathematicians may, if they wish, apply themselves to calculating Scotlands contribution to that minuscule CO2 production, harmless in any case since solar activity is the likeliest cause of cyclical climate change.

"The reduction in Arctic sea ice and increase in Antarctic sea ice has happened before and is called the polar see-saw or polar anomaly. (See Svensmarks attached paper.) The polar see-saw occurs during Dansgaard-Oscheger events (also called Bond events). It is now apparent the later 20th century warming was a Bond event. Gerald Bond found evidence of cosmogenic isotope changes at each of a long series of warming followed by cooling events (he has able to track 25 events through current interglacial Holocene and into the last glacial period, at which point he reached the limit of the range of the proxy analysis technique) which indicates a solar magnetic cycle change caused the warming followed by cooling cycle.",2_1

The derived equation revealed a rapid and sustained global energy rise starting in about 1941. The true average global temperature anomaly change -trend is proportional to global energy change.",2_1
"My interpretation is much more direct. During our solar maximum, we had more UV that raised cloud levels and atmospheric height, leading to warm days. Now that the sun is taking a nap, UV has plunged, the atmosphere shortens, and we get lower clouds with colder days. Dont see any need for a CO2 thesis at all.",2_1
"Well, the word ""only"" is somewhat cute in comparison with the ""mainstream"" fashionable ideology. The IPCC said that they saw a 90% probability that ""most"" of the recent warming was man-made. The present paper would reduce this figure, 90%, to less than 50% because the Sun itself is responsible for 1/2 of the warming and not the whole 50% of the warming could have been caused by CO2 because there are other effects, too.",2_1
"Recall that the CO2 warmists in their half-baked models stubbornlykeep focusing only on total solar irradiance (TSI), which itself varies only about 0.1% over an 11-year cycle (and thus by itself is no real climate driver) and ignore all the other amplification mechanisms. Well, the results of this study, as do dozens of others studies, show you cant do that. Like it or not the sun is a real player. Eventually the CO2 warmists will have to admit this, as anyone with even just an inkling of intuition would do.",2_1
"Indeed, Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) presented persuasive evidence that solar variability is leaving an imprint on climate, especially in the Pacific. According to the report, when researchers look at sea surface temperature data during sunspot peak years, the tropical Pacific shows a pronounced La Nina-like pattern, with a cooling of almost 1o C in the equatorial eastern Pacific. In addition, there are signs of enhanced precipitation in the Pacific ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ) and SPCZ (South Pacific Convergence Zone) as well as above-normal sea-level pressure in the mid-latitude North and South Pacific, correlated with peaks in the sunspot cycle.",2_1

"We hypothesise that Saturn and Jupiter provide the background drumbeat which governs the solar cycle. The modulation of that beat by the other heavy gas giant planets and magnetically active inner planets is the subject of further investigation which has been taking place on this blog and others. We are getting closer to solving the puzzle and being able to predict the future evolution of solar activity levels with a high degree of confidence. That will revolutionise climate science, because once we can confidently predict solar activity, climatologists will rediscover the Sun as an important climate driver. Watch this space.",2_1
"In conclusion, the claim that the global surface temperature record is a fractional random signal fundamentally different from the harmonic nature of the astronomical signals is not supported by the data and careful analysis. The global surface temperature record appears to be made of natural specific oscillations with a likely solar/astronomical origin plus a noncyclical anthropogenic contribution during the last decades. Indeed, because the boundary condition of the climate system is regulated also by astronomical harmonic forcings, the astronomical frequencies need to be part of the climate signal in the same way the tidal oscillations are regulated by soli-lunar harmonics.",2_1
"Some solar scientists claim that 20th century solar activity was merely ??? high ?? without warranting the ???grand maximum?? label, but that is a distinction without a difference. Whether ???high?? or ???grand,?? since we don??t yet understanding all of the ways that living inside the sun??s extended corona might affect global temperature (and there is the rub, that this understanding is still very immature), 80 years of any high level of solar activity could very well account for most or all of the modest warming over this period.",2_1
"In sum, the attempts by warmists to dismiss the role of the Sun in climate change are based upon oversimplified and elementary analyses which conveniently ignore hundreds of peer-reviewed papers finding an increase of solar activity over the 20th century to a solar ""Grand Maximum"" at the end of the 20th century, solar-driven ocean oscillations -which have profound and lagged effects upon climate, and many other solar amplification mechanisms described in the literature, all of which provide plausible mechanisms and explanations for all or most of the global warming of the 20th century, as well as the current 18-year global warming ""pause.""",2_1
"The sun has both direct and indirect effects on our climate. Solar activity changes on cycles of 11 years and longer. When the sun is more active it is brighter and a little hotter. More important though are the indirect effects. Ultraviolet radiation increases much more than the brightness and causes increased ozone production, which generates heat in the high atmosphere that works its way down, affecting the weather. Also, an active sun diffuses cosmic rays, which play an important role in nucleation of low clouds, resulting in fewer clouds. In all these ways the sun warms the planet more when it is active. An active sun in the 1930s and again near the end of the last century helped produce the observed warming periods. The current solar cycle is the longest in over 100 years, an unmistakable sign of a cooling sun that historical patterns suggest will stay so for decades.",2_1
"These results agree with the evidence mustered by Hoyt and Schatten and Georgieva, Kirov, and Bianchi for a phase shift circa 1920 in the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures. However, we can suggest, here, that the supposed negative correlation between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures prior to 1920 rests on a misconstrued understanding of the data. As can be seen in Figure 6, the relationship between the change in the warming rate and solar activity is still positive, i.e. the warming rate is peaking near the peaks of solar cycles 10, 12, and 14, but at a much reduced level, indicative of the lower level of solar activity during the period. Indeed, for much of solar cycle 12, and all of solar cycle 14, the warming rate is negative, but the change in the warming rate is still following the level of solar activity, becoming less negative as solar activity increases, and more negative as solar activity decreases. Still, there is a strong suggestion in Figure 6 of a phase shift circa 1920 in which the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures changes dramatically before and after the shift. Before the shift, the lunar period dominates, and the solar period is much weaker. After the shift, the solar period dominates, and the lunar period becomes subordinate.",2_1
"Some of the global warming on other planets (and our blue, not green planet) has been attributed to the Sun and/or nearby cosmic rays. The shared positive sign in most cases is suggestive but I remain an agnostic here. The internal, mostly random planetary variability is still a plausible explanation for all the changes.",2_1

"Who knew? However, a casual question back in 2000, from a colleague while I was doing post-doctoral work at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Toronto, led to surprising revelations on climate change. My colleague, an astrophysicist, asked me how cosmic rays from supernovae could affect life on earth, which led me to explore this area of study. I found that the sun's variability as well as unrelated cosmic ray variations, explain a surprisingly large amount of the observed climate variations, from the 11-year solar cycle to geological time scales. In fact, models including the real effect of the sun also do a much better job in explaining 20th century global warming than those limited to the influence of human carbon dioxide emissions alone. h/t Kevin B",2_1
"1) Empirical Solar / CRF / Cloud Cover correlation: In principle, correlations between CRF variations and climate does not necessarily prove causality. However, the correlations include telltale signatures of the CRF-climate link, thus pointing to a causal link. In particular, the cloud cover variations exhibit the same 22-year asymmetry that the CRF has, but no other solar activity proxy (Fichtner et al., 2006 and refs. therein). Second, the cloud cover variations have the same latitudinal dependence as the CRF variations (Usoskin et al. 2004). Third, daily variations in the CRF, and which are mostly independent of the large scale activity in the sun appear to correlated with cloud variations as well (Harrison and Stephenson, 2006).",2_1

"There is much more to El Nio event than a simple warming of the eastern tropical Pacific. They have strong impacts on weather around the globe. A strong El Nio event can also cause an upward shift in the temperatures of two-thirds of the surface of the global oceans, while having no apparent long-term effect on the other one-third. Those upward shifts in surface temperatures give the appearance of a relatively steady rise in global surface temperatures when the data are looked at globally. As a result, the rise in global surface temperatures have been incorrectly attributed to human-induced global warming. That means the climate science community is no closer to finding evidence of the human fingerprint in global warming than they were in the early 1990s, the early years of the IPCC. The IPCC has no one to blame for that than themselves, with their focus on carbon dioxide.",2_1

And as NOAA point out, it has been around for at least 1000 years, so it wont be going away tomorrow!",2_1
"The hypothesis of manmade global warming depends on manmade greenhouse gases being the cause of the recent warming. But the satellite-era sea surface temperature record indicates El Nio and La Nia events are responsible for the warming of global sea surface temperature anomalies over the past 31 years, not manmade greenhouse gases. And ocean heat content data since 1955 indicate the tropical oceans warmed naturally to depths of 700 meters in response to La Nia events. Ive searched sea surface temperature records for more than 4 years and the ocean heat content records for more than 3 years, and I can find no evidence of an anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in those two datasets. That is, the warming of the global oceans has been caused by Mother Nature, not anthropogenic greenhouse gases.",2_1
"There was a warming between 1977 and 1999 that coincides with the warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean.

It is beyond my comprehension why anyone would seek to force fit an alternative explanation based on CO2 since 1975/particulates from 1940-1970/solar forcing before 1940 etc. when the ENSO explanation explains the temperature trend extremely well and much more elegantly.,2_1

"Global warming and cooling have closely followed the phases of the PDO. The most significant pattern of PDO behavior is a shift between warm and cool phases that last 20 to 30 years. In 1905, the PDO shifted to its warm phase. In 1946, the PDO changed to its cool phase. In 1977, the PDO returned to its warm phase and produced the current warming. In 2007-8, the PDO turned cold again, so we can expect several decades of naturally-caused global cooling.",2_1

"The whole CO2 argument is tiresome and absurd.The unmoved mover is the sun. The system below responds to the variations in the sun with alag. The warming was because when the oceanswent into their warm cycle (remember there is far greater energy in warm water than in cold dry air), the natural response had to be a warming in the north where there is more land- because equatorialocean warming increases the transport of warm humid air northward. That air has to then warm areas where there is dry air. Ifyou dry out warm humid air,then you warm the airtemperature if the wet bulb is constant. So there is warming over the continents, BUT IT ONLY CONTINUES UNTIL THE OCEANS HAVE ADDED THEIR INPUT. The leveling off of temps is completely consistent with an atmosphere that has absorbed the heat from the warming cycles of the oceans that occurred in tandem from 1995-2007 (warm PDO was 1978-2007, warm AMO 1995 till present, but it will shift).",2_1

"A larger point is that the current warming is not unusual. Even greater warming has occurred many times in the last 11,000 years. It has been as much as two degrees warmer than now three times in the last 10,000 years. More important, warming episodes are followed by cooling episodes that can be disastrous for mankind. The long-term trend for the last 3000 years of the Holocene has been cooling. We are slowly sliding into the next long cold at about half a degree C per millennium.",2_1
"Of the 102 studies that looked at the twentieth century temperature record to determine whether it showed unusually extreme warming, only 3 concluded that it did.

Because they want to promote the idea that the world is currently experiencing unprecedented warming due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2 .

"So basically, all that the global warming advocates really have, as the evidentiary basis for their theory, is that global temperatures were a little higher than usual in the late 1990s. Thats it.

It is also clear that the climate of the Earth's polar regions are linked. Intensification of atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (indicated by a stronger Siberian High and northern circumpolar circumpolar westerlies and a deeper Icelandic Low) and to a lesser degree in the Southern Hemisphere (stronger circumpolar westerlies and deeper Amundsen Sea Low) occurs 8200 8400 years ago. Date from Siple Dome (West Antarctica) and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project ice core climate proxies for northern and southern circumpolar westerlies show remarkably concurrent major intensification periods between 6000 and 5000 years ago and starting 1200 600 years ago.

"Lovejoy??s 99% solution fails to quantify or even accurately describe the patterns of natural variability of the Late Holocene climate. Therefore, his conclusion that the warming since 1880 (~0.4 C per century) cannot be natural is unsupported in his analysis. While it is possible that up.to half of the industrial era warming might be due to the rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, this is hardly conclusive and certainly not at 95% confidence, much less 99%. Davis and Bohling demonstrated that 140-yr runs of 0.4 C per century runs of warming and cooling were not unusual in the GISP2 ice core. The fact that the industrial era slope is roughly twice the norm of the past 2,000 years does not prove that it is of anthropogenic origin. The Little Ice Age was quite possibly the coldest phase of the Holocene since the 8.2 KYA Cooling Event. The LIA was characterized by maximum glacial advances and the most extensive sea ice coverage since the onset of the Neoglaciation (end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum).",2_1

Therefore, if Arctic systems are presently struggling more so than in the past, it points to factors other than anthropogenic climate change as the root cause.

July temperatures then increased to 7.8C between 5700 and 3800 cal yr BP and temperatures have decreased slightly during the past 3800 yr and Maximum estimated July temperatures were reached between 5800 and 3000 cal yr BP, at which time they exceeded present-day values.

"This brings us to the Number of The Week: 86.7% . As TWTW reported last week, Professor Emeritus of Geology Don Easterbrook has given the annual temperature reports in a different frame of reference. Based on his calculations from the GRIP-2 ice cores from Greenland, for 9,100 of the past 10,500 years it was warmer than today. That is, 86.7% of the time during this 10,500 year period it was warmer than today, and 13.3% of the time it was colder (at least in Greenland).",2_1
"In conclusion, the results of these several studies demonstrate that the so-called unprecedented warmth of the late 20th century is simply a myth, as far as China is concerned. The apparent great warmth of this period in this particular part of the world appears to have been but a common manifestation of naturally-induced and regularly-recurring conditions similar to those that have been experienced in prior millennia. These results also serve as a testimony against those who would deny the existence of an extensive (hemispheric or global) Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, as well as an extensive Roman Warm Period and Dark Ages Cold Period, and cyclical climate changes in general.

The SAT record depicts essentially the same thing, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period being not quite as high as the peak temperature of the former warm period. In the case of the ACWT record, this relationship is reversed, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period slightly exceeding the peak temperature of the former warm period; however, the most recent maximum temperature is very short-lived and rapidly declines to hover around a value that is about 1C cooler over the last few years of the record.

Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6 +- 0.8 deg C higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 1210 ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada",2_1
"The fallacy in this logic is of course that when energy is lost it has a cooling effect not a warming effect. But the AGW logic has flipped reality upside-down so that atmospheric warming is caused by the energy being lost to space which is really in actual fact, cooling.",2_3

I have yet to be convinced that CO2 warming effect is significant enough to be responsible for the temperature rises alarmist automatically attribute, without any scientific proof, to CO2, and particularly anthropogenic CO2 emissions. If it is any other reasons to the alarmists presumptions of CO2, then the solution to the global warming problem changes from one of prevention to remedial action. However, thanks to the alarmist everyone is now looking at the wrong solution to the problem.",2_3

"The final question that arises is what prediction has the AGW made that has been demonstrated, and that strongly supports the theory. It appears that there is NO real supporting evidence and much disagreeing evidence for the AGW theory as proposed. That is not to say there is no effect from Human activity. Clearly human pollution (not greenhouse gases) is a problem. There is also almost surely some contribution to the present temperature from the increase in CO 2 and CH 4 , but it seems to be small and not a driver of future climate. Any reasonable scientific analysis must conclude the basic theory wrong!!",2_3
"However, these two increases did not take place together. Much of the observed temperature rise of 0.5 C occurred before 1940, whereas most of the additional carbon dioxide (over 80%) entered the atmosphere after 1940. Increased greenhouse gases cannot explain a temperature rise that occurred before the major increases in these gases existed in the atmosphere.",2_3
"We find that there is no requirement to invoke greenhouse gas driven mechanisms to explain the temperature changes that are recorded in the ice core record. Instead, we show that changes in the reflection/absorption of sunlight by atmospheric dust are plausible in both an historical sense, by correlation, and in terms of the basic physics of radiative transfer.",2_3
Is not evidence about what causes global warming. Proof that global warming occurred is not proof that CO2 was mainly responsible.,2_3

"" I f we'd had a warming due to CO2, this should appear as a deviation from the simple harmonic model since 1950.There are no signs of any additional heating due to CO2 as the IPCC claims in their reports, thus the assumed CO2 effects in IPCC climate models are exaggerated.The net effect of CO2 is thus so modest that it can not be seen in this data.""",2_3

They claim things like, the atmospheric CO2 absorption bands are already saturated, or something else very technical. . While it is true that most of the CO2-caused warming in the atmosphere was there before humans ever started burning coal and driving SUVs, this is all taken into account by computerized climate models that predict global warming. Adding more should cause warming, with the magnitude of that warming being the real question. But Im still open to the possibility that a major error has been made on this fundamental point. Stranger things have happened in science before.",2_3

The entire basis for CO2 causing the Earth to warm catastrophically is false. There are cities in California that show a pronounced cooling even while CO2 continues to rise Eureka, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento. San Francisco shows a gradual increase in temperature that corresponds to population growth, but not to CO2 in the atmosphere. see this.",2_3
"Surface Radiation: I set this in accordance with the NASA 2011 energy budget since the other two energy budgets hugely exaggerate this to accommodate their huge back radiation values. I showed in my analysis in the paper Infrared-Absorbing Gases and the Earth's Surface Temperature that there was an upper bound of 5.8% on the amount of back radiation incident on the surface. This was without even invoking the fact that heat flows from warm to cool surfaces and conditions when the air is warmer than the surface other than within a very few tens of meters are infrequent. Because I set the back radiation warming at an estimated value of 1%, the Surface Radiation is (51 + 1 - 7 - 24)% = 21%.",2_3
"The last result does not look obviously compatible with the theory that world-wide warming has been caused by CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases.

"1. Convection accounts for approximately 67% of the total amount of heat transfer from the Earth's surface to the troposphere, the condensation of water vapour for 25% and radiation accounts for only 8%. As the heat transfer in the troposphere occurs mostly by convection, accumulation of CO2 in the troposphere intensifies the convective process of heat and mass transfer, because of the intense absorption of infrared radiation, and leads to subsequent cooling and not warming as commonly believed.",2_3

"In the stratospherethe absorption of sunlight by the plentiful ozone trace gas is the main source of heat. Naturally the absorbed radiative energy must be given off once again. In the stratosphere this occursfor the most part through heat radiation into space by CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2in the atmosphere has a cooling effect, ozone a warming effect!",2_3
What happens to an air parcel when a CO 2 molecule absorbs an IR photon? Since the molecule can only exist in specific discrete energy states it jumps to a higher (excited) energy state. However in this process the translational energy of the CO 2 molecule does not change. The average speed of the molecules of the air parcel containing this CO 2 molecule has not increased. Since temperature is related to the root mean square speed of the molecules the temperature of the air parcel does not increase. CO 2 does not trap heat.,2_3
"Yet all the while Hertzberg, Latour, Postma, Kleespies and other non-partisan scientists are telling us is that there is no such thing as a Greenhouse Effect. If you study their writings you will see how they openly address the complexities within the physics and thermodynamics to show that our planets surface temperature can be explained without the chicanery concocted behind closed doors. We can see that there is no need to postulate an additional radiative GHE, and that the entire concept is based on a misinterpretation and an incorrect comparison of physical metrics.",2_3

"2. Closer examination of the last century using better data shows that from 1940 to 1975 the earth cooled at about 0.1C/decade while atmospheric carbon increased. But any warming effect of atmospheric carbon is immediate. By 2003 or so we had discovered global dimming, which might be adequate to explain this 35-year non-correlation. But what had seemed like a good fit between recent atmospheric carbon and global warming now looks shaky, in need of the recently-discovered unquantified global dimming factor to explain 35 years of substantial cooling. I reckon the last century of correlation evidence now neither supports carbon emissions as the cause nor eliminates it. Further quantitative research on global dimming might rescue this bit of evidence, or it might weaken it further.",2_3

Fig 3 shows the data from the termination of the last Glacial Cooling (Major Glaciation) that ended some 15,000 20,000 years ago through the current Interglacial Warming of today. The four instances where the temperature changes precede the CO2 curve are clearly shown. All the Vostok data going back some 420,000 years show exactly the same behavior. Any objective scientist looking at that data would conclude that it is the warming that is causing the CO2 increases, not the other way around as Gore claimed.

"Ghostly artistic images of water vapor using data from the Aqua satellite's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder. NASA. Without such a theory it is impossible to predict changes in atmospheric circulation, it is impossible to predict changes in the hydrological cycle, it is impossible to predict storm frequencies, intensities and tracks. Future climate cannot be predicted without a theory explaining how climate works, yet the IPCC has confidently made predictions regarding changes in storms, precipitation and climate for decades, even centuries into the future. If something as seemingly simple as water vapor can have such complex and bewildering impacts on Earth's climate why does the IPCC and the climate crisis crowd continue to insist that all fault lies with CO 2 ? It could be that even they realize that blaming global warming on water vapor would give them no political leverage. After all, 70% of our planet's surface is covered with water and not even the most wild-eyed geoengineering proponent would propose we attempt to control the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.",2_3
"Like water vapour, carbon dioxide also absorbs some incident Solar radiation, particularly in the 2.7 micron band. So it prevents this radiation from reaching and warming the surface. However, the atmosphere has only about 0.04% carbon dioxide, compared with about 1% to 4% water vapour. Each water vapour molecule absorbs and radiates in a far wider range of wavelengths than each carbon dioxide molecule and so, as some have estimated, the overall effect of all the carbon dioxide could be as little as 0.1% that of all the water vapour. And that effect is likely to be a net cooling effect anyway.",2_3
"Furthermore, the missing hotspot in the atmospheric warming pattern observed during the last warming period proves that (1) the IPCC climate theory is fundamentally broken, and (2) to the extent that their theory correctly predicts the warming signature of increased carbon dioxide, we know that carbon dioxide definitely did not cause the recent warming (see here for my full explanation of the missing hotspot ). The alarmists keep very quiet about the missing hotspot.",2_3
"In its Endangerment Finding, the EPA produced no physical evidence of the existence of the hotspot. Further, with the divergence of atmospheric data from the surface data, which has been inflated to show a greater warming trend than before, it is doubtful if anyone can show the existence of a pronounced hotspot.",2_3
"Naturally they claim this ancient forest was wiped out by global warming, somehow forgetting to mention that for hundreds of millions of years prior to the Carboniferous age atmospheric carbon dioxide had been somewhere north of 3,000ppm, possibly far north.

"Since 0.9 K warming has occurred since 1750 (Central England Temperature Record), the 2 K threshold beyond which we are told a net climate-related cost begins to arise may well not be crossed until the end of this century.

"However, climate scientists and climate models instead falsely assume that the Kirchhoff, Planck, and Stefan-Boltzmann laws can be applied to greenhouse gases and that they behave as blackbodies. Dr. Robitaille shows prior work from Hottel et al demonstrating that the emissivity of both of these greenhouse gases decrease with temperature , the opposite of the climate science assumption that greenhouse gases increase emissivity and absorptivity with temperature. For conservation of energy, emissivity must equal absorptivity for all materials and gases, therefore increases in temperature decrease both emissions and absorption of infraredradiation by the greenhouse gases water vapor and CO2, i.e. they become less 'greenhouse like' gases as temperatures increase, a self-regulatory mechanism that suggests less climate sensitivity to CO2 with increasing temperature.",3_1
"Two new climate studies have delivered a critical blow to global warming alarmism. Estimates driven by old computer models projected an increase of 1.2 C in global temperature if carbon-dioxide levels double. However, new research relying on available empirical data shows the climate's sensitivity to higher amounts of carbon dioxide is much lower than previously thought as low as 0.02 C if carbon-dioxide levels double. With these modest temperature projections, perhaps the Chicken Little tendencies of climate alarmists will subside. READ MORE",3_1

"The sensitivity atmospheric temperature to CO2 from measured data, is therefore much lower than was predicted and that includes the argo data. Alternatively rather than a CO2 sensitivity misjudgement, all that heat that Dr. Trenberth is famously looking for, very well could be sitting in the deep ocean making too little impact over 100 years to actually measure and all it would take is a tiny bit more (or less) oceanic intermixing than models predict for that huge heatsink to be the true source of measured climate change. It could potentially have overwhelmed the CO2 effect without our knowing.",3_1

John Christy provided the model projections. Spencer used the both the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH) and the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) calculations. The disparity is striking. Since the greenhouse effect takes place in the lower atmosphere, this is further evidence that the planet is not as sensitive carbon dioxide emissions as advocated by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).",3_1
"When I looked at historic temperature and CO2 levels, it was impossible for me to see how they could be in any way consistent with the high climate sensitivities that were coming out of the IPCC models. Even if all past warming were attributed to CO2 (a heroic assertion in and of itself) thetemperatureincreases we have seen in the past imply a climate sensitivity closer to 1 rather than 3 or 5 or even 10 (I show this analysis in more depth in this video ).",3_1
"Readers may recall that last December I published an informal climate sensitivity study at Bishop Hill, here .

This study uses the same approach as mine, based on changes in global mean temperature, forcing and heat uptake over 100+ year periods, with aerosol forcing adjusted to reflect satellite observations. Headline best estimates of 2.0C for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and 1.3C for the arguably more policy-relevant transient climate response (TCR) are obtained, based on changes to the decade 200009, which provide the best constrained, and probably most reliable, estimates.

Truth n 10 The water vapour content of the air has been roughly constant since more than 50 years but the humidity of the upper layers of the troposphere has been decreasing: the IPCC foretold the opposite to assert its ???positive water vapour feedback?? with increasing CO2.

"August, 2007 RESEARCH UPDATE: Our peer-reviewed paper showing the natural cooling behavior of tropical cirrus clouds in response to warming was published on August 9 in Geophysical Research Letters. (The UAH news release is here. ) In that paper we describe satellite evidence for a natural cooling mechanism (negative feedback)that occurs when the tropical atmosphere heats up. This is in contrast to all leading climate models, which have cirrus clouds behaving as a positive feedback, amplifying warming tendencies.",3_1
"Several negative feedback mechanisms have been proposed by others to explain the stability of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP). If these ocean thermostat mechanisms effectively suppress warming in the future, then coral reefs in this region should be less exposed to conditions that favor coral reef bleaching. In this study we look for regional differences in reef exposure and sensitivity to increasing SSTs by comparing reported coral reef bleaching events with observed and modeled SSTs of the last fifty years. Coral reefs within or near the WPWP have had fewer reported bleaching events relative to reefs in other regions. Analysis of SST data indicate that the warmest parts of the WPWP have warmed less than elsewhere in the tropical oceans, which supports the existence of thermostat mechanisms that act to depress warming beyond certain temperature thresholds.",3_1

"Q: Dr. S. Fred Singer: Perhaps to clarify the discussion. We need to separate these results of model experiments - of course that's all they are are experiments with models, from scenarios of how CO2 will increase. These are two separate issues. As far as I can tell from the IPCC report, their estimate or their numbers for the what is call the ""climate sensitivity"" that is, how much temperature rise will be produced by doubling of CO2 alone, all other things being equal, has not changed since 1990. It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds.

"???In the 1950s the polar bear population up north was estimated at 5,000. Today it??s 20- to 25,000, a number that has either held steady over the last 20 years or has risen slightly.

"Baffin Bay population. The IUCN says that the initial estimate (1984-1989) for this subpopulation was 300 to 600 bears. A second survey (1993 to 1997) estimated this declining population to be 2,074 bears. Please note that the previous two sentences are not the result of some bizarre typo. The extremely low initial numbers were presumably due to a flawed methodology (data collected in the spring in which the capture effort was restricted to shore-fast ice and the floe edge off northeast Baffin Island while recent work has shown that an unknown proportion of the subpopulation is typically offshore during the spring) How can the IUCN confidently conclude that this subpopulation is decreasing? Because the current (2004) estimate based on simulations is that the population is 1,600 bears. The reason for the decline is that the subpopulation appears to be substantially over-harvested. One of the reasons that it is over-harvested is that in 2004 Nunavut increased its hunting quota from 64 to 105 bears per year because reports from Inuit hunters that polar bear numbers in BB had grown substantially. Note that nowhere in this Orwellian story is the decrease in the Baffin Bay polar bear population blamed on receding summer ice due to global warming.",3_2

"It??s highly unlikely the atmospheric levels of CO2 will reach 1,000 ppm in the next couple of centuries, but if they did, it appears that at least one major and widespread species of cold water coral can adapt within six months.

"Changing Waters: Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, who has since left, gives four succinct reasons why we should not fear that enhanced CO2 will cause the so-called ocean acidification and it is not a threat to creatures in the oceans: 1) higher concentrations of CO2 in the past; 2) buffering from elements such as calcium and magnesium; 3) biology of mollusks allow them to survive in freshwater that is quite acidic and 4) adding CO2 to saltwater aquariums promotes plant and coral growth.

However, in going from lighted to shaded conditions, elevated CO 2 extended the time during which maximal rates of photosynthesis were maintained. Thus, elevated CO 2 slowed the rate of photosynthetic decline caused by the onset of shading. Consequently, shaded leaves of CO 2 -enriched saplings maintained greater rates of photosynthesis for longer periods of time than did shaded leaves of saplings growing in ambient air, which allowed the CO 2 -enriched leaves to sequester greater amounts of carbon than was expected from photosynthetic measurements made under steady-state conditions.",3_3

In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%.

Extra carbon dioxide helps to shrink the Sahara Desert, green the planet and feed the world. Ergo, carbon dioxide is neither a pollutant nor dangerous, but an environmental benefit.",3_3
"The scientists begin their article noting that Growth of plants under elevated CO2 frequently leads to increased growth rates, but that was not the focus of their study. Many others have grown tobacco in elevated CO2 and confirmed that tobacco, like virtually every other plant in the world, benefits from higher concentrations of CO2. Matros et al. made a series of measurements on how elevated CO2 impacts nicotine, and they conclude that Cultivation of tobacco plants at elevated CO2 leads to a marked decrease of nicotine, the major nitrogen-rich secondary metabolite in tobacco at lower nitrogen supply and At higher nitrogen supply, nicotine content was not further influenced by CO2. See, if you are trying to quit smoking, elevated CO2 is your friend and it generally acts to lower the nicotine level of the plants!",3_3
CO2-Related Genotypic Variation in White Spruce (5 Apr 2011) Observations suggest that highly-CO2-responsive genotypes of a wide variety of earths plants -- from food crops to lumber crops -- could well be selected to take advantage of their genetic ability to optimize their growth in response to projected future increases in the airs CO2 content ...

"Simply said, there is no need whatever to reduce CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide is not ""a pollutant"" as the EPA claims. It is, along with oxygen for all living creatures, vital to the growth of all vegetation. The more CO2 the better crops yields will occur, healthier forests, and greener lawns. From a purely scientific point of view, it is absurd to reduce emissions.",3_3
"Elevated soil moisture had little influence on wheat yield, regardless of atmospheric CO 2 and O 3 concentrations. Elevated O 3 concentrations, however, negatively influenced wheat yield at both atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Nevertheless, grain yield was always higher for plants grown at the elevated CO 2 concentration. Indeed, elevated CO 2 increased grain yield by 21, 7 and 11%, respectively, for each of the three years of the study, indicating that elevated CO 2 concentrations ameliorated some of the negative impacts of O 3 -induced damage on grain yield.",3_3
"Elevated CO 2 did not significantly impact vegetative growth in three of these weedy species. For Spergula arvensis , however, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment increased maximum leaf length by an average of 15%, regardless of light treatment, and total dry weight by 20 and 68% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Similarly, elevated CO 2 significantly enhanced reproductive success in only one of these species, by increasing the number of seeds in Poa annua by 50 and 26% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Thus, CO 2 -induced increases in vegetative biomass do not necessarily lead to increases in reproductive biomass, and CO 2 -induced increases in reproductive biomass do not need to be preceded by increases in vegetative biomass. In contrast to the limited significant effects of elevated CO 2 on vegetative and reproductive growth, reduced light nearly always caused significant decreases in plant vegetative and reproductive success. Moreover, the negative effects of reduced light on these parameters were typically much stronger than any positive effect resulting from atmospheric CO 2 enrichment. Total plant dry weights, for example, decreased by 32 to 62%, depending upon species, when grown in reduced, rather than in full light, while atmospheric CO 2 enrichment only increased total plant dry weights by 2 to 30%. What it means",3_3
"As the air's CO 2 content continues to rise, poplar trees will likely exhibit increases in growth that will shorten the time from planting to harvest and enhance their importance in the agro-forestry market. Also, with greater productivity and biomass production, significantly more carbon will be sequestered within the woody components of poplar trees and the soils in which they grow, helping to slow the rate of rise of the air's CO 2 content. Thus, the use of Populus species in managed tree plantations would appear to be a promising and prudent cultural practice for future foresters.",3_3
"First off, plant height, leaf number, leaf area, fresh weight, and dry weight all increased in the elevated CO 2 treatments with respect to values obtained under ambient conditions, regardless of the length of CO 2 exposure (see Table 1 below).

"Where are the defences of bristlecones as valid proxies in tree ring terms? While we??ve pointed out a number of possible mechanisms for fertilization in the 20th century, the most prominent theory is CO2 fertilization The usual mechanism by which CO2 fertilization is hypothesized to lead to increased ring widths is through increased water use efficiency. Water use efficiency changes are studied in a series of remarkable articles by Xiahung Feng of Dartmouth, of which Tang, Feng and Funkhouser is notable. ""Plant water use efficiency"" was defined by Farquhar et al 1989 (cited by Tang et al) as the ratio of net carbon fixed to the total water cost. The connection between CO2 fertilization and increased water use efficiency (W) is summarized by Tang et al. as follows:",3_3

"When I hear concerns about soil erosion, I always think about my grandma. She was an amazing woman. She grew up in Huron in the heart of the Great Depression, which just happened to coincide with the Dust Bowl. Growing up, my sister and I listened to her stories of dealing with the dust storms, stuffing rags in the window sills and the cracks around the doors in an attempt to keep the dust out of the house. Despite her best efforts, a fine film of dust would still cover the interior of the house.The dust from the Dust Bowl claimed crops, cattle, and the lives of two children in Huron. To this day, when contractors cut into houses that survived the Dust Bowl, they find sand in between the interior and exterior walls. The Dust Bowl eroded more than the soil; it eroded a way of life.Erosion is a problem that persists to this day, and it's responsible for dust storms, mudslides and sinkholes. Fortunately, plants in forests, grasslands, and everywhere else set roots in the soil and help the soil stay put, and plants around the globe are getting a boost from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Although many people, spurred by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, think ""going green"" means using less carbon dioxide, plants prefer just the opposite.We all know plants need carbon dioxide to breathe, but many don't know plants turn that carbon dioxide into carbon in the form of the roots, stems, trunks, branches, leaves, and fruit with which we are more familiar. And according to a new study by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the greener the planet gets.The report, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts, published by The Heartland Institute (where I am a research fellow), cites thousands of peer-reviewed studies rising atmospheric CO2 levels are helping almost all plants grow bigger, become more efficient in using water, and better withstand the stress of high air temperature.In a way, this CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere is to plants like an oxygen mask is to a winded football player helping to prepare him for the next play.More CO2 in the atmosphere also means plants start to grow in places they couldn't before, reducing the amount of erosion and, consequently, dust in the air in places around the globe, while increasing the potential for agriculture and wildlife habitat as the range of certain plant species expands.Increased levels of CO2 also have been found to increase the fine-root density in some plants by up to 184 percent, and a 55 percent increase in above ground biomass despite water and nutrition limitations meaning plants become better at anchoring the soil in place and allowing water to permeate the surface, which is especially important during droughts.This would have been great news for my grandma and everyone else who survived the Dust Bowl. Improved farming techniques have played an important part in reducing the amount of erosion around the world, and these efforts certainly will be helped by having more CO2 in the atmosphere. Instead of being a detriment to plant growth, more CO2 acts as a fertilizer, making plants grow bigger, faster, more resilient, and more abundant, greening the world we live in.",3_3

"The answer is as simple as not interfering with the historical and still-ongoing increase in the atmosphere's CO 2 concentration, since this latter phenomenon dramatically increases the water use efficiencies of essentially all agricultural crops -- see Water Use Efficiency (Agricultural Species) in our Subject Index -- thereby enabling farmers to produce ever-increasing quantities of the vast array of grains, fruits and vegetables, as well as animal feed crops, upon which the inhabitants of all nations of the earth ultimately depend for their sustenance, all of which can be accomplished without the need to extract ever greater quantities of ever-more-difficult-to-obtain water from earth's soils.",3_3

By 2004, for example, they say that ""roughly 50% of ambient trees and 75% of fumigated trees produced cones.""

And as a result, they demonstrated that ""both plants maintained growth better at double-ambient CO 2 than their counterparts at ambient CO 2 in the presence of drought,"" such that reductions in total above-ground biomass due to drought were 42% for maize and 36% for sorghum at ambient CO 2 , but only 18% for maize and 14% for sorghum at double-ambient CO 2 .",3_3

"The fundamental problem with Obama's approach to carbon-dioxide emissions is the idea that the U.S. can solve the problem. No matter what the U.S. does, emissions will continue to soar, because so many people in the developing world want to come out of the dark and into the bright lights of modernity.

The additional 10 percent U.S. reduction yields another one one-hundredth of a degree.

Zollis essay makes the argument that sustainability and resilience are tied to two different world views, and I find his argument convincing. Resilience thinking is associated with systems thinking, uncertainty, and wicked problems. Resilience is arguably a concept that has broader political palatability than does sustainability.

"To build on these promising beginnings during the course of the negotiations will in my view require several further recognitions and realizations. First, the major developing nations need to recognize that playing the game they have been playing may seem clever now, but won't work over the long haul. China and India have enthusiastically supported a second round of mandatory emissions cuts for the developed nations, but not for them. They hope that in a second round the developed economies will have to pay billions and billions of dollars to them to install modern emissions-saving technologies and also that energy-intensive industrial production will continue to move from carbon-constrained economies to theirs. China, India, and other developing and poor countries understand that going on an energy starvation diet when you are already energy poor offers far more pain than gain. The potential harms caused by global warming are minor annoyances when compared to the immense benefits of affordable energy. Instead of playing a cute double-faced game, China and India should articulate the reasons why the demands from the energy-rich nations for them to accept mandatory emissions reductions before the technology is available to make those reductions affordably are simply another form of eco-imperialism.",4_2
"From this article: The report also suggests that allowing carbon-constrained U.S. firms to trade credits with firms in China or India, where emission reduction measures are relatively inexpensive, would yield an estimated U.S. carbon price as low as $15 per tonne rather than $40 per tonne, thereby saving the American economy about $145 billion per year in increased energy costs. So while the Earth appears to be cooling , we should pay real money to China for highly-questionable ""emission reductions"" that would, at best, ""cool"" the world by an additional amount too small to measure? And while we make those payments, China would continue to build two new coal plants per week ?!",4_2
"But there's the rub. To get results will require widespread cooperation among countries. Even if developed countries froze their emissions, worldwide emissions would still grow around 150 percent by 2050 because of the increase from developing countries. Moreover, if China or India does not eventually agree to binding targets, some greenhouse-gas producers will simply set up shop there because it is cheaper.",4_2
The problem is that the basic approach is unworkable. International negotiations have centered on placing the economic burden of addressing climate change on a few dozen developed countries while asking nothing from more than 150 developing countries. But the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly the developing world. Any approach to effectively address increasing emissions of greenhouse gases must capture emissions from developed and developing countries.,4_2
"China and India, among other developing countries, argue that they should be allowed to increase carbon emissions. They're still developing and require higher rates of economic growth.

The model makes no allowance for the fact that over peak demand periods, only about 10% of the wind generation can be relied on. It also does not consider the need for extra transmission lines and the poor efficiency of the gas fired power stations that must be built to back up wind.

If the wind turbines had operated at 100% capacity for the entire time, they still would have only supplied 60% of Germanys needed power. However, wind turbines rarely run near 100% rated capacity. Very often they produce only a small fraction of their rated capacity because the wind is highly variable and often does not blow very hard. On April 18 wind turbines in Germany produced their peak for the month: 17 gigawatts, but only for about 2 hours, before rapidly dropping off again to 8 GW at around midnight. On that day, all wind turbines together briefly reached 53% of their rated capacity. And that was their best day.",4_4

The simulated sea surface temperatures marched happily on their way skyward. Why? Because theyre FORCED by greenhouse gases, while the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans are not.

"The IPCC says in its latest report: ""The differences in radiative forcing estimates between the present day and the start of the industrial era for solar irradiance changes and volcanoes are both very small compared to the differences in radiative forcing estimated to have resulted from human activities. As a result, in today's atmosphere, the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes. ""(Ch.2, p.137) This position will be more closely considered. The change in the total solar radiation since 1750 is estimated by the IPCC to 0.12 (-0.06 / +0.18) W/m2 (Ch.2, Table 2.12). This value is of the order of the relative change per decade of satellite measurements. ACRIM has measured as for the cycles 21-23% or 0.5W/m2 0037. The absolute error is about the satellite but with 3W/m2. How could you determine, however, without satellites in the past such small changes is not explained. To a completely different result, however come Solanki and Fligge (CRL 26 (1999) 2465).

"Since the complex models have failed in this respect, and since there are insufficient deep-ocean observations to provide reliable quantitative evidence of the putative heat accumulation below 2000 m, still less to determine the mechanism of the imagined heat transfer, still less again to apportion duly the respective contributions of anthropogenic, solar and subsea volcanic influences on the benthic heat accumulation, it is surely unreasonable for our simple model to be expected to do what the complex models have self-evidently failed to do and what cannot be done by any model, simple or complex, unless and until measurements of far higher resolution than is now to hand become available at all points of the oceanic column. For instance, the 3500 automated Argo bathythermograph buoys have a resolution equivalent to taking a single temperature and salinity profile in Lake Superior less than once a year: and before Argo came onstream in the middle of the last decade the resolution of oceanic temperature measurements was considerably poorer even than that, especially in the abyssal strata.",5_1

The irrelevance is because none of the most contentious policy responses to climate change are resolved *even if* we accept that 97.1% of climate scientists believe that human activity is very likely causing most of the current GW (which of course is not what the study has shown). And more broadly, the sprawling scientific knowledge about climate and its changes cannot helpfully be reduced to a single consensus statement, however carefully worded.

"Thanks for the reply. Ive seen the Jacoby-dArrigo references and, in fact, thats what occasioned my interest. It was included in their northern treeline index which seemed a little odd to me, since the site is far from the treeline. I also notice that the earliest portion of the chronology (not used by Jacoby and dArrigo) is based only on one tree. If you were doing the chronology today, would you include the portion based on only one tree in your site chronology? Also do you know (from past notes or otherwise) any details about potential logging or other forestry operations in the area?",5_1
"Jaworowski illustrates this by comparing ice core data to other CO2 proxy data, such as stomata indices, which gives higher atmospheric CO2, with more variation than the ice core data over the last 8,000 years.",5_1

"Even though his work was as dodgy as anyones I feel sorry for Briffa at times. He appears to develop a kind of Stockholm Syndrome towards the hectoring Mann. In his heart he is well aware of the flaws in Manns research and in the early years he is capable of mutiny. 1024334440 , 2002. I am sick to death of Mann stating his reconstruction represents the tropical area just because it contains a few (poorly temperature representative ) tropical series. He is just as capable of regressing these data again any other target series , such as the increasing trend of self-opinionated verbage he has produced over the last few years , and (better say no more). Cook sympathises: Of course, I agree with you. We both know the probable flaws in Mikes recon, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff. It is puzzling to me that a guy as bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit more objectively.",5_1
"Leaving that aside, did Mann get it right? . There is no doubt that reconstructing past temperatures from proxy data is fraught with danger. Take tree ring records. They sometimes reflect rain or drought rather than temperature. They also get smaller as a tree gets older so annual or even decadal detail is lost.",5_1
"In Mr. Wigleys view at the time, ice cores were unreliable and correlate very poorly with temperature. He said the link between ice core and temperature variation was close to zero and tree rings were less than 50% reliable. The main external candidate is solar, and more work is required to improve the paleo solar forcing record. Another U.S. scientist, Gary Funkhauser of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona, was also cool to the idea of tree rings as indicators of past temperatures. He wrote in September, 1996, that he tried every trick out of my sleeve to get meaningful climate records out of certain tree ring records collected by Russian scientist Stephan Shiyatov.",5_1
*Paleoclimate reconstructions capture quite well moderate long term variability of 50 years and more but fail to pick up the much more variable decadal variability,5_1
"The process quickly gets complicated when proxies from many areas are brought together to map out ancient climate trends for a region. Because different proxies yield varying pictures of changes through time, some paleoclimate maps can look vague and generalized. It's also a matter of having enough computer power to handle not only the data, but to incorporate it with the oceanic, atmospheric, and other models, says Hughes.",5_1
"Aside from solving the various crossword puzzles, the more fundamental issue is: is this a valid way of adjusting the Mannian PC1?

Remember this is 11 years after Hansen??s comments of certainty to the Senate and five years after the 1995 IPCC Report. It is worse now with fewer weather stations and less data than in 1990.,5_1
And this is why I have no doubt that most of what we see in the global temperature is just fractal noise. And here are some other important properties of fractal noise:,5_1
The blue line is how Hansen currently shows Phoenix a sharp warming trend. Apparently the UHI effect in Phoenix has disappeared since he wrote his 1999 paper. He cooled the past by about a degree and warmed the present by almost that much.,5_1
"Several oddities have turned up, unexpected variations which seem to have a pattern relating to station and station geographical location. Some of this may be related to UHI and similar thermal mass / water effects.",5_1
"If people reading iPhones can spot such problems and know the temperature data isn??t valid, and a citizen run CWOP program can use MADIS analysis of the data sight unseen and note it??s FUBAR, why can??t our meteorological experts at The Weather Channel figure it out?",5_1
"Climate realists are generally willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Earth has warmed somewhat in recent decades. In fact, though, it is not obvious that even this modest claim is true. Satellite data show no net warming for as long as such data have been collected, i.e., back to 1979. Ocean measurements show no net warming over that period, either; the evidence for warming is based on land measurements. But the accuracy of land measurements depends on proper siting and maintenance of weather stations. One obvious factor is the urban heat island effect: many weather stations are located in cities, which grow warmer as more people and buildings accumulate. Thus, increasing temperatures at such stations may be measuring urban development rather than the climate. We all know that the urban heat island effect is realchance of frost in outlying areasyet the data that alarmists rely upon do not take it into account.",5_1
"The adjustments do seem to be very aggressive in identifying any effects that might have artificially created a cooling trendbut lax in finding and correcting effects that mighthave artificially created a warming trend. First and foremost, the changing urban heat island effect in growing cities seems to be under-corrected (Again there is debate on this -- the proprietors of the model believe they have fixed this with a geographic normalizing, correcting biases from nearby thermometers. I and others believe all they are doing is mathematically smearing the error over a larger geography).",5_1
"Weather stations can no longer be trusted. 90% of the 1,064 weather stations do not meet government standards because contamination is present.",5_1
"But this comment, although it appeared, is now lost in the barrage. And Michael Getner, the PBS ombudsman, is backpedalling the role PBS played in allowing Watts to speak to their viewers. But as they say, when you are taking flak, it means youre over the target. Anthony Watts, through ordinary careful data collation and analysis, threatens the standing of NOAAs assertions about the integrity and accuracy of U.S. temperature records, and that has the alarmosphere in apoplexy.",5_1
"In 1980, a paper by a senior New Zealand meteorologist (JWD Hessell), which was peer-reviewed and published in a reputable science journal, concluded that there was no evidence of New Zealand warming since 1930. The author found that the raw data overstated the extent of warming because thermometers had been affected by shelter, screenage and urbanisation. This directly contradicts the Salinger thesis.",5_1
The sooner these simple facts are acknowledged by responsible journalists the sooner reason will return to this important matter of public interest. Kiwis deserve to have a national temperature record they can trust but at the moment it is dubious.,5_1
"Furthermore, Hansens models predicted the temperature rise if human carbon dioxide emissions were cut back drastically starting in 1988, such that by year 2000 the atmospheric carbon dioxide level was not rising at all. But in reality, the temperature did not even rise that much. Which proves that the climate models dont have a clue about the effect of carbon dioxide on world temperature.",5_1
"Moreover (and you wont find this in the Academy paper), even if you believe, wrongly, that 2014 was the hottest year on record, 2014 was yet another year where the deviation widened between the models hot forecasts and the actual cooler temperatures.",5_1
"The figure is scientifically meaningless. A statistical distribution can be calculated over the results from the some 73 global climate models, but the models have never been validated and only one valid model would have been sufficient. As discussed above, the models have significant, unknown, internal uncertainty. Further, CO2 emissions do not explain the significant warming of the first part of the 20 th century, the current pause in warming of at least a decade (in the atmosphere and at least 15 years on the surface) and the regional nature of the of the warming, which is occurring in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere with little warming elsewhere.",5_1
"Lee et al.s controlled experiment (climate model) showed increased flow through the Indonesian Throughflow during the 2007/08 and 2008/09 La Nias. This is basically the explanation for why the ocean heat content of the Indian Ocean did not cool proportionally during those La Nias. Note, however, in Figure 3 that the ocean heat content of the Indian Ocean did drop during the 2005/06 La Nia, which seems to contradict Lee et al.s model. The Lee et al. model also did not appear to respond to the 1998-01 La Nia, while the data indicate the warming of the Indian Ocean actually began then, after a drop a few years earlier.",5_1
"Claim C: On its face, the climate model assumptions (including high positive feedbacks) of substantial warming from small changes in CO2 are inconsistent with relatively modest past warming. Scientists use what is essentially an arbitrary plug variable to handle this, assuming anthropogenic aerosols have historically masked what would be higher past warming levels. The arbitrariness of the plug is obvious given that most models include a cooling effect of aerosols in direct proportion to their warming effect from CO2, two phenomenon that should not be linked in nature, but are linked if modelers are trying to force their climate models to balance. Further, since aerosols are short lived and only cover about 10% of the globes surface in any volume, nearly heroic levels of cooling effects must be assumed, since it takes 10C of cooling from the 10% area of effect to get 1C cooling in the global averages.",5_1
"Each of the complex climate models used by the IPCC grossly overstates the amount of warming the planet has experienced during the past 120 or so years. In addition, based on the idea that temperatures should rise right along with CO 2 emissions, these models have missed the entire 18+ year hiatus in rising temperatures.",5_1
"In order to take precautions, you have to know what you are taking them against. Some computer models project that the global temperature in ten years time will be warmer than todays. Other computer modelsproject that global temperature will be cooler ten years hence. Read more here .",5_1
"In summing up their discussion of the subject, therefore, Laxon et al. simply state that their results ???show that errors are present in current simulations of Arctic sea ice,?? and they thus conclude, in the closing sentence of their paper, that ???until models properly reproduce the observed high-frequency, and thermodynamically driven, variability in sea ice thickness, simulations of both recent, and future, changes in Arctic ice cover will be open to question.??",5_1
"In September, 2008, Der Spiegel here wrote: More heat waves, no snow in the winter: After years of calculation work, the climate prognoses of the German government are complete. With unprecedented accuracy they predict how the climate will change by the year 2100 region by region. Unfortunately the unprecedented accuracy theyve seen up to nowis not what they had in mind.",5_1
"The geophysicist slammed the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), saying their stand on global warming is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity.",5_1
"The evidence, therefore, indicates that the current generation of climate models (when run as a group, with the CMIP5 prescribed forcings) do not reproduce the observed global warming over the past 20 years, or the slowdown in global warming over the past fifteen years.",5_1
"Notice that the potential positive bias in model feedbacks can, in some sense, be attributed to a lack of model complexity compared to the real climate system. By complexity here I mean cloud variability which is not simply the result of a cloud feedback on surface temperature. This lack of complexity in the model then requires the model to have positive feedback built into it (explicitly or implicitly) in order for the model to agree with what looks like positive feedback in the observations.",5_1
"It is also the scenario which, when fed into the worlds climate models, produces the greatest warming by the end of the centuryabout 4.5C (although the world abounds with observations that suggests that this temperature rise is overblown, but that is the subject of a different analysis).",5_1
"Climate Models: On the Global Warming Policy Foundation blog, David Whitehouse discusses the failure of the IPCC to discard models that clearly have no predictive value. The average of the models used greatly overestimate the increase in temperatures from additional CO2. The continued use of these models illustrates a failure in IPCC methodology procedures. Discarding models that greatly overestimate warming would result in a significant reduction in the upper bound of climate sensitivity estimates. Such action would render many climate issues, such as species extinction, moot. The huge amounts of money provided by climate alarm would shrink, endangering many climate researchers.",5_1
"So, even with all of 140 cherries picked, we still see evidence there is something wrong with the IPCC models in general. And I believe the problem is they are too sensitive, and thus are predicting too much future global warming.",5_1
why cant climate models properly simulate sea ice losses in the Arctic Ocean or sea ice gains in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica?,5_1
"The overall picture is clear. Scenario A is the emissions scenario from 1990 that is closest to the observed emissions outturn, and yet there has only been a third of a degree of global warming since 1990 about half of what the IPCC had then predicted with what it called substantial confidence.",5_1
"Storch: If things continue as they have been, in five years, at the latest, we will need to acknowledge that something is fundamentally wrong with our climate models. A 20-year pause in global warming does not occur in a single modeled scenario. But even today, we are finding it very difficult to reconcile actual temperature trends with our expectations.",5_1
"While this might sound reasonable, it turns out that the radiative signature of forcing is much larger than that of feedback. As a result, one can get pretty good agreement between models and observations even when the model feedbacks are greatly in error. Another way of saying this is that you can get good agreement between the model behavior and observations whether the cloud feedbacks are positive OR negative. This is another fact I will be demonstrating on December 16.",5_1
"The authors compared recently constructed temperature data sets from Antarctica, based on data from ice cores and ground weather stations, to 20th century simulations from computer models used by scientists to simulate global climate. While the observed Antarctic temperatures rose by about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius) over the past century, the climate models simulated increases in Antarctic temperatures during the same period of 1.4 degrees F (0.75 degrees C).",5_1

They charge that NASA is relying too heavily on complex climate models that have proven scientifically inadequate in predicting climate only one or two decades in advance.",5_1
"The models systematically underestimate dust emission, transport and optical depth, and year-to-year changes in these properties bear little resemblance to observations, the authors wrote. These findings cast doubt on the ability of these models to simulate the regional climate and the response of African dust to future climate change.",5_1
"Read here and here . Climate models are dependent on atmospheric relative humidity staying constant if CO2 increases are going to cause global temperatures to increase. Again, real world evidence proves models are wrong.",5_1
"Twenty-eight million weather balloons had shown by 1999 that the key assumption in the climate models was wrong. Without feedbacks, the models only produce 1.2C of warming with a doubling of CO2. With feedbacks the simulations ramp that up to a dangerous 3 ??? 4 degrees C, and water vapor was the most important feedback. It??s just no fun for the Global Worriers without it.",5_1
"These studies arebasedon models, ofwhich only a portion of which represent basic physics (e.g. the pressure gradient force, advection and the universal gravitational constant), with the remainder of the physics parameterized withtunedengineeringcode (e.g see ).",5_1
"The two main points here are (1) the observations are much cooler than the mid-range of the model spread and are at theminimum of the model simulations and (2) the satelliteadjustment for surface comparisons is exceptionally good. The implication of (1) is that the best estimates of the IPCC models are too warm, or that they are too sensitive to CO2 emissions.",5_1
"The Zombie in the room here is the dead science being revived endlessly by Brown and the IPCC, despite the evidence that climate models are based on flawed assumptions, which we know from 28 million weather balloons , 3000 ARGO buoys , 800,000 years of ice cores , and 30 years of satellites .",5_1
I think what they mean is that this is a somewhat implausible post-hoc rationalisation of the failure of the models to conform to reality; perhaps the copyeditor missed it.,5_1
The extended calculation using coupled runs confirms the earlier inference from the AMIPruns that underestimating the negative feedback from cloud albedo and overestimating the positive feedback from the greenhouse effect of water vapor over the tropical Pacific during ENSO is a prevalent problem of climate models.,5_1
"The references here independently show that core model assumptions are wrong. Models assume that relative humidity will stay the same over the tropics as the world warms, that clouds are a positive feedback and not a negative one, and that cloud changes are a feedback and not a forcing in their own right. These are three critical and demonstrable errors.",5_1
"Modeled versus observed correlations with time from 1982 to 2011 are shown in the following two maps. The scale below each map is correlation coefficient, not temperature. A positive correlation coefficient of 1.0 (hot pink) would indicate an area warmed linearly from 1982 to 2011, while a negative correlation coefficient of -1.0 (purple) would indicate an area cooled linearly over that period. Basically, what the maps are showing are the modeled and observed warming and cooling trend patterns. There are no similarities. Keep those two images in mind the next time you see a peer-reviewed paper that projects regional climate on decadal or multidecadal bases. The modelers have no hope of doing so unless they can predict ENSO and its impacts on regional sea surface and land surface temperatures. They simulate both poorly.",5_1
"However, there is absolutely no evidence that the upper end climate models are anywhere close to being right.",5_1
"Perhaps the trade-winds are affecting the climate. But what drives the trade-winds? The models cant predict the trade-winds until they understand what drives them. If it turns out to be cloud cover changes, or lunar orbits, or solar magnetic effects, cosmic ray effects, or all of the above that means there is another whole factor or lots of them that the models did not include. Every warming factor added to the models reduces the power of CO2 as a driver. How much does this reduce your future projections by? (Or your future job prospects?)",5_1
"The models perform poorly in the North Pacific (Figure 16) and in the South Pacific (Figure 17), more than doubling the observed warming rates.",5_1
"The simulation of clouds in climate models remains challenging. There is very high confidence that uncertainties in cloud processes explain much of the spread in modelled climate sensitivity. However, the simulation of clouds in climate models has shown modest improvement relative to models available at the time of the AR4, and this has been aided by new evaluation techniques and new observations for clouds. Nevertheless, biases in cloud simulation lead to regional errors on cloud radiative effect of several tens of watts per square meter.",5_1

"Climate models are portrayed by the media and by political entities like the IPCC as splendid tools for forecasting future climate.

* Continuing scientific dispute exists over whether observations are confirming or disconfirming key short-run predictions of climate models such as an increase in tropospheric water vapor and an increase in tropical tropospheric surface temperatures relative to tropical surface temperatures;,5_1
"Computer simulations of the climate, referred to as general circulation models (GCMs), can be used to assess the sensitivity of climate to changes that might result from increased greenhouse gases. However, because physical feedbacks between Earths atmosphere (including clouds), the ocean, and the biosphere remain incomplete in the models, their use as a tool is limited.",5_1
"The most important measure of model skill is of course its ability to predict previously unmeasured (or unnoticed) phenomena or connections in ways that are more accurate than some simpler heuristic. Many examples exist, from straightforward predictions (ahead of time) of the likely impact of the Pinatubo eruption (Hansen et al 1992), the skillful projection of the last three decades of warming (Hansen et al 1988; Hargreaves 2010) and correctly predicting the resolution of disagreements between different sources of observation data e.g., between ocean and land temperature reconstructions in the last glacial period (Rind and Peteet 1985), or the satellite and surface temperature records in the 1990s (Mears et al 2003; Thorne et al 2011). Against this must be balanced predictions that did not match subsequent observationsfor instance the underestimate of the rate of Arctic sea ice loss in CMIP3 (Stroeve et al 2007).",5_1
"The successful launch of this new atmospheric monitoring system and its detailed diagnosis of clouds will be a very important achievement. The need for this data shows that the understanding and skillful prediction of the climate system has more uncertainties than has been recognized in multi-decadal climate projections, such as reported by the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments.",5_1
"Imagine that! No consensus , not even in terms of the sign of the longwave cloud feedback. Perhaps the GCMs really are cursed. And to rid existing models of that possibility, Huang concludes his paper by stating that ""more studies are still required to understand how clouds modify global warming, even with regard to the longwave aspect alone.""",5_1
"Aside from that, I think some of the criticism is a bit exaggerated. But it really depends on what you want to look at. Some models are worse than others, but there are some models which are used in seasonal prediction and are able to provide some description of ENSO albeit with biases. My own analysis of various GCMs also suggest that they reproduce the characteristics of the NAO too.",5_1

I would suggest that if NCAR-CCSM3 was chosen, one might need to take the projections about impact of farming with a grain of salt. That said: it??s possible precipitation is the greater effect and my comparison of models shown above can??t tell us anything about that.",5_1

"Pat Michaels is in San Francisco this week attending the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and presenting a poster detailing the widening mismatch between observations of the earths temperature and climate model projections of its behavior. Since most global warming concern (including that behind regulatory action) stems from the projections of climate models as to how the earths temperature will evolve as we emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels to produce energy), it is important to keep a tab on how the model projections are faring when compared with reality. That they are faring not very well should be more widely knownPat will spread the word while there.",5_1
"However, it should be understood that RCMs operate under a set of boundary conditions set by whatever GCM is being used. Hence, if the GCM does not do an adequate job of reproducing the climate signal of a particular region, the RCM will simply mimic those inaccuracies and biases, and propagate the uncertainties even further, albeit at a regional scale.",5_1
"Even when climate alarmists cheat by cherry-picking the data they use to show climate models are consistent with observed temperatures, their efforts fail. John Christy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville shows climate models project from 157 percent to 297 percent more warming than has been recorded by any data set in the global mid-troposphere where the models indicate greenhouse gases should amplify warming the most. Models projected 230 percent more warming than the median value of the combined observational data sets. READ MORE",5_1
World leaders are making critical decisions based upon predictions of General Circulation Models or Global Climate Models GCMs) that humans are causing global climate change or global warming. Global climate models attempt to describe the earth's climate and are used in variety of applications.

And what did they thereby find? Quoting them again, they say that ""the CMIP5 decadal simulations of rainfall exhibit very low skill when assessed across Australia and across a range of time-scales from yearly to longer which extend to the entire decade."" And it is this finding that leads them to ultimately conclude that the current state of precipitation predictability ""is not enough to drive impact models at decadal timescales and to influence policy and decision making.""",5_1

Uncertainty about important feedback mechanisms is one reason why the ultimate goal of climate modeling forecasting reliably the future of key variables such as temperature and rainfall patterns is not realizable.,5_1
"Too, we dont have accurate actual measurements of all locations, levels, and components (like temperature, moisture, wind speed, and so on) of the atmosphere, land, ocean (and outer space). The number of measurements we do have is minuscule compared to the actual size of the earth. So it is hard to reconcile the output of models with what the actual state of the earth is, though, of course, this is a necessary step. The process whereby the models are adjusted so that they conform to both the actual measurements and to the scientists expectations is called tuning . All models undergo extensive tuning until the majority of it users are satisfied of the output.",5_1
"In his book, Climate Change: A Natural Hazard, William Kininmonth, former head of Australias National Climate Centre says, The simple one-dimensional energy balance model used by the IPCC to justify its radiative forcing hypothesis is unrealistic in its portrayal of processes at the earth-atmosphere interface. The IPCC model suggests that the heat and latent energy exchange between the underlying surface and the atmosphere is a direct response to the imbalance of solar energy and terrestrial radiation at the surface. Such a proposal is at odds with the physics of the surface energy exchange processes. Its one of many errors made to achieve a result; actions that are the opposite of even poor science.",5_1
"The first peer reviewed study determines that today's climate models will never be able to predict the climate.

"In the absence of model verification or falsification, Stainforth et al. (2007) describes the challenges of building confidence in climate models. Owing to the long time scales present, particularly in the ocean component, there is no possibility of atrue cycle of model improvement and confirmation, particularly since the life cycle of an individual model version (order of a few years) is substantially less than the simulation period (order of centuries). Model projections of future climate states relate to a state of the system that has not been previously experienced. Hence it is impossible to calibrate the model for the future climate state or confirm the usefulness of the forecast.",5_1
"Most of the fundamental problems in our still immature understanding of climate have remained unresolved for decades. Some cannot be resolved at all.

"I welcome articles from you that show the IPCC models have skill on the multi-decadal time periods. Until you (or others) do, all the IPCC-type models can tell us is that the climate system is sensitive to the addition of CO2, other greenhouse gases, aerosols and land use/land cover change. We do not need a multi-hundred million dollar modeling program to provide regional and local impact scenarios when the models have shown no skill at doing this on multi-decadal time scales (even when run in a hindcast mode).",5_1
"However, for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012, only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3 trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend.

"Given the inadequacies of current climate models, how should we interpret the multi-model ensemble simulations of the 21 st century climate used in the IPCC assessment reports? This ensemble-of-opportunity is comprised of models with generally similar structures but different parameter choices and calibration histories. McWilliams (2007) and Parker (2010) argue that current climate model ensembles are not designed to sample representational uncertainty in a thorough or strategic way. Stainforth et al. (2007) argue that model inadequacy and an inadequate number of simulations in the ensemble preclude producing meaningful probability density functions (PDFs) from the frequency of model outcomes of future climate. Nevertheless, as summarized by Parker (2010), it is becoming increasingly common for results from individual multi-model and perturbed-physics simulations to be transformed into probabilistic projections of future climate, using Bayesian and other techniques. Parker argues that the reliability of these probabilistic projections is unknown, and in many cases they lack robustness. Knutti et al. (2008) argues that the real challenge lies more in how to interpret the PDFs rather whether they should be constructed in the first place. Stainforth et al. (2007) warns against over interpreting current model results since they could be contradicted by the next generation of models, undermining the credibility of the new generation of model simulations.",5_1
"Trying to take the planetary energy balance equationand torture it into something that it was never intended to do is pointless and misleading at best. The planetary energy balance equation is the simplest possible climate model. On the other hand there are the general circulation global climate models, which are of enormous complexity. In between is a whole class of energy balance climate models, which were very popular in the 1950s 1980s, the Wikipedia gives a good introduction to this class of models, which includes box models, radiative-convective models, higher dimension versions of the zero-dimensional planetary energy balance model, and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (statistical/dynamical models). Different models can be used depending the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales.",5_1

"In his new paper, Lovejoy applies the same approach to the 15-year period after 1998, during which globally averaged temperatures remained high by historical standards, but were somewhat below most predictions generated by the complex computer models used by scientists to estimate the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions.",5_1
"And the NRC reminds us that there are other fundamental uncertainties as well. There is a ""wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions of global climate change"" that can only be reduced by ""major advances in understanding and modeling"" of greenhouse gas emissions, the role of aerosols in the global climate system, and the incredibly complex ""feedback"" mechanisms in the Earth's climate.",5_1
The models say the Earth system ought to accrue energy at the rate of 3W/m 2 . Instead the best estimate we have of recent energy balance suggests we??ve been losing energy at a rate of about 0.1 W/m 2 (Knox and Douglass 2010). The models don??t match the observations.,5_1
"Simulations using several IPCC-class general circulation models (GCMs) are used to demonstrate that the adjustment to climate change itself takes place over decadal timescales, meaning that ENSO response is not statistically significant during the 21st century. This implies that current model intercomparisonexperiments are insufficient to measure the true range of ENSO climate sensitivity. However, significant changes to atmospheric teleconnectionsmay take place within the 21st century: the NCARCommunity Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), for example, predicts harsher winters in the Southwestern US during La Nia and weaker Australian teleconnections during both El Nio and La Nia.",5_1
"3) Chaotic Uncertainty. It is well understood that climate is a chaotic object and climate models reflect that property. The outcome of a particular model run (???simulation??) depends sensitively on the initial conditions; even minute changes can lead to greatly differing outcomes. For example, the five runs of a Japanese MRI model show temperature trends that differ by almost a factor of 10, an order of magnitude. (If more runs had been performed, the spread would have been even greater.) One can show that taking the mean of an ensemble of more than 10 runs leads to an asymptotic value for the trend. However, most modelers face constraints on time and money and are not able to carry out so many runs. For example, of the 22 models in the IPCC compilation of ???20 CEN?? there are 5 single run models, 5 two-run models, and only 7 models with four or more runs.",5_1
"When the data sets are compared to model projections for the tropical mid-troposphere, where climate models say a tropical hot spot should emerge, the models do even worse, overstating the warming by between 169 and 414 percent overestimating the median of the observational data sets for the tropics by 330 percent.",5_1
"Even in the absence of external forcing, climate models often exhibit long-term trends that cannot be attributed to natural variability . This so called climate drift arises for various reasons including: perturbations to the climate system on coupling component models together and deficiencies in model physics and numerics.To illustrate this we have focussed on simulated trends over the second half of the 20th century Below depths of 1000 to 2000m, drift dominates over any forced trend in most regions. As such steric sea-level is strongly affected and for some models and regions the sea-level trend direction is reversed.",5_1
GoshWhere Did All of Those Expensive Climate Models Go Wrong?,5_1
"Pearce also tries to suggest that forecasting climate change is like forecasting the seasons i.e., easy. Unfortunately, Edward Lorenz proved that claim to be false very nearly half a century ago, in the landmark paper in a climatological journal that founded chaos theory. Lorenz demonstrated that unless we knew the values of the millions of parameters that define the climate to a precision that is not and can never be in practice attainable the long-range prediction of climatic behavior would be impossible by any method. Yet the UNs case for climate alarm is based almost exclusively on the output of models that have been demonstrated, time and again, to fail. Not one of the models on which the UN relies, for instance, had predicted that there would be 15 years without any statistically-significant global warming the years 1995-2009 inclusive.",5_1
"Callaghan and Power's analysis of their lengthy and comprehensive new data base reveals results that appear to be totally at odds with the contentions of the IPCC, which are based more on the output of numerical models of the atmosphere than on real-world observations. And their results also highlight the fact that even real-world observations may be misleading, especially if they do not cover a long enough time period to reveal the oscillatory nature of various aspects of earth's climate. References",5_1
This is yet another reason why we need to move away from using multi-decadal global climate models as the tool to communicate to policymakers. They are NOT skillful multi-decadal projection tools even in terms of global average radiative forcing.,5_1
How Have Climate Models Done Predicting Cloud Coverage? Not Too Well,5_1

"In the end the authors brand this unsolved mystery the ?Holocene temperature conundrum.? We have heard this song before, usually from climate modelers asking for more grant money to ?improve? their wonky programs. There may be some wiggle room in the interpretation of the proxy data but the new study, M13, is supposed to be the latest and most accurate temperature history available. This points directly back at the models as the weak link in the story. ?If the M13 reconstruction is correct, it will imply major biases across the current generation of climate models,? Liu et al conclude. This is more than just a conundrum for climate scientists?those computer models are the embodiment of climate science's understanding of how climate works here on planet Earth. If the models do not work, climate science has gotten it wrong.",5_1
"I invite anyone to defend this perspective, and we will present as a guest weblog post. From my perspective, if a global climate model cannot simulate current climate, as well as changes in the climate system, accurately it cannot produce accurate projections of climate in the coming decades.",5_1
"The authors write that ""how well the CMIP5 GCMs simulate climate at regional scales is of great interest to both researchers and resource managers,"" because, as they say in stating the obvious, ""a model that fails to reproduce aspects of the past climate will be less likely to produce a correct projection of future climate.""",5_1
"??And that strength of models is, if you still do not consider adequately the effect of clouds? They can not explain the polar climate? They can not predict the next hurricane season?",5_1
"The dynamical trends were similar in the observations and the model simu- lations, except that the dynamical effect was much larger in the observations than in both model experiments. In other words, the dynamical effects are clearly present in the state-of-the-art global climate models, but they are much too small to match the data.",5_1
"As for some other specifics, the two researchers determined that (1) ""long-term mean vertically integrated cloud fields have quite significant deficiencies in all the CMIP5 model simulations,"" that (2) ""both the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models display a clear bias in simulating too high LWP in mid-latitudes,"" that (3) ""this bias is not reduced in the CMIP5 models,"" that (4) there have been ""little to no changes in the skill of reproducing the observed LWP and CA ,"" that (5) ""inter-model differences are still large in the CMIP5 simulations,"" and that (6) ""there is very little to no improvement apparent in the tropical and subtropical regions in CMIP5.""",5_1
"While climate models are supposed to be snapshots of the Earths real climate, the mismatch between observed and modeled climate behavior shows that even the best models are not accurate and are likely overestimating outcomes. Gerald North, a Texas A&M atmospheric sciences and oceanography professor, estimates that climate models overestimate warming by roughly 50 percent.",5_1
(And what fundamental feedback in the tropical Pacific are climate models still unable to simulate correctly? Thats right: Bjerknes feedback. See Bellenger et al (2013) .),5_1
"Further, because climate models cant simulate where, when, why and how the ocean surfaces warm and cool around the globe, they cant properly simulate land surface temperatures or precipitation. And if they cant simulate land surface temperatures or precipitation, what value do they have? Quick answer: No value. Climate models are not yet fit for their intended purposes.",5_1
"Once again, these problems with regional impacts studies are just the tip of the iceberg. Climate modelers admit privately that global climate models are not capable of providing accurate predictions of regional climate.",5_1
"comprehensive comparison of characteristics of the planetary albedo () in data from two satellite measurement campaigns (ERBE and CERES) and output from 20 GCMs, simulating the 20th-century climate, is performed. Discrepancies between different data sets and models exist; thus, it is clear that conclusions about absolute magnitude and accuracy of albedo should be drawn with caution. Yet, given the present calibrations, a bias is found between different estimates of , with modelled global albedos being systematically higher than the observed. The difference between models and observations is larger for the more recent CERES measurements than the older ERBE measurements. Through the study of seasonal anomalies and space and time distribution of correaltions between models and observations, specific regions with large discrepancies can be identified. It is hereby found that models appear to over-estimate the albedo during boreal summer and under-estimate it during austral summer. Furthermore, the seasonal variations of albedo in subtropical areas dominated by low stratiform clouds, as well as in dry desert regions in the subtropics, seem to be poorly simulated by the models.",5_1

"Many of these myths were created by proponents of manmade global warming who have no understanding of the coupled ocean-air processes that result in El Nio and La Nia events. Those persons look at an El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index and wrongly assume the index represents all of the processes of ENSOwhen, in reality, the index simply shows the impact of El Nio and La Nia events on the variable being measured for that index. ENSO indices (like NINO3.4 region sea surface temperature anomalies presented in the post) do not capture in recharge aspects of La Nia events that are evident in the ocean heat content data for the tropical Pacific and they do not capture the impacts of the discharge and redistribution processes of major El Nio events that are plainly visible in the sea surface temperature anomalies of the Atlantic-Indian-West Pacific Oceans(90S-90N, 80W-180) .",5_2

"PHOENIX (Feb. 3, 2010) -- Climate scientist William Sprigg delivered a bold challenge to his fellow climate scientists in a blockbuster address to EUEC 2010 in Phoenix, Arizona on February 2.Sprigg, an adjunct research professor in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona, led the technical review of the first global warming report issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990.In his address to the Thirteenth Annual Energy and Environment Expo, Sprigg took on the ClimateGate scandal and called for ""serious reforms"" of the global scientific community. He warned of a growing perception that ""the IPCC is biased, conflicted, pushing political agendas.""Sprigg called for a new climate research agency supported not entirely by the government, but in conjunction with the private sector.""We need to stick to our scientific principles,"" Sprigg said, referring at least in part to the critical importance of sharing data with other scientists so that hypotheses and methodologies can be checked and double-checked. ""We need to improve our peer preview process, and expand the stakeholders' role to keep us all honest.""Sprigg's remarks were videotaped by Heartland Institute Research Fellow James G. Lakely, attending the conference not generally friendly to skeptics of predictions of catastrophic, man-made global warming.Heartland Senior Fellow James M. Taylor, managing editor of Environment & Climate News, also attended the event, and during the Q&A; following Sprigg's presentation asked the scientist what he thinks the future holds for the IPCC.Sprigg nodded as Taylor referred to ""mounting scandals"" at the IPCC and then responded, ""There will be some reform. I think there's going to be big changes in the peer review process for the IPCC. There will be--there are--calls for the head of Pachauri. Some of my colleagues have written letters saying that he needs to be taken off the job ...""The video is available on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeEIl0-0EOA and also on the Web sites of Environment & Climate News, The Heartland Institute, and Global Warming Facts.",5_2

"Once the UNFCCC treaty was a done deal, the IPCC and its scientific conclusions were set on a track to become a self fulfilling prophecy.

National and international science programs were funded to support the IPCC objectives.",5_2

The cherry-picker scene was kinda sciencey, yet somehow even that aroused questions rather than convincing me. I had no means to evaluate the science aspects back then, so resolved to look into them (wow, armed only with a long-ago physics degree did that take years longer than I thought!)

CO2-hysteric Pachauri now has a blog--with a comment section,5_2
"Whatever the reason, it is indeed vastly more difficult to publish results in climate research journals if they run against the tide of politically correct opinion. Which is why most of the sceptic literature on the subject has been forced onto the web, and particularly onto web-logs devoted to the sceptic view of things. Which, in turn, is why the more fanatical of the believers in anthropogenic global warming insist that only peer-reviewed literature should be accepted as an indication of the real state of affairs. They argue that the sceptic web-logs should never be taken seriously by real scientists, and certainly should never be quoted. Which is a great pity. Some of the sceptics are extremely productive as far as critical analysis of climate science is concerned. Names like Judith Curry (chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta), Steve McIntyre (a Canadian geologist-statistician) and blogger Willis Eschenbach come to mind. These three in particular provide a balance and maturity in public discussion that puts many players in the global warming movement to shame, and as a consequence their outreach to the scientifically inclined general public is highly effective. Their output, together with that of other sceptics on the web, is fast becoming a practical and stringent substitute for peer review.",5_2
"Because global warming advocates are much more comfortable arguing #1 than #2, they like to paint skeptics as all denying #1.

Because the sea ice continues to disintegrate, and the prolonged blizzards cause ongoing chick mortality, the colony has yet to recover.?? And When sea ice breaks up before their chicks have matured and grown their waterproof feathers, chicks that are swept into the ocean are likely to die .",5_2

"It is not that simple to tell who is and who is not a climatologist or an expert on climate change and global warming. Ross McKitrick once said that ?there is no such thing as an ?expert? on global warming, because no one can master all the relevant subjects. On the subject of climate change everyone is an amateur on many if not most of the relevant topics.? (as quoted by R. M. Carter, ?The Futile Quest for Climate Control,? Quadrant, November, 2008, p. 10; online atwww.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2008/451/the-futile-quest-for-climate-control). In his recently published book Climate: The Counter Consensus (2010), Prof. Carter suggests that ?scientists who study climate change come from a wide range of disciplines? which he ?groups into three main categories? (p. 22). He claims that ?most of the scientific alarm about dangerous climate change is generated by scientists in themeteorological and computer modeling group, whereas many (though not all)geological scientists see no cause for alarm when modern climate change is compared with the climate history?

I was invited, and duly registered on line, but the moment the narrow and poisonous faction that controls the scientific input to the panel realized I was coming a very senior scientist prominent as the first named lead author of one of the previous UN climate assessments wrote to me making it very plain, in effect, that anyone who dared to raise difficult questions would not be welcome, and he refused to allow me to attend.",5_2

More important, the researchers reported elsewhere that they had failed to find these same effects in studies in the field, details they neglected to reveal in the PNAS article. This is a critical omission because laboratory studies are designed to mimic what happens in the real world.

Articles like mine that take issue with the way in which the war is being waged are not particularly welcome.

A more politically diverse scientific community would, overall, support a healthier relationship between science and politics. It should come as no surprise that the increasing politicization of science has come to make science more political rather than politics more scientific. At the same time, the more partisan and/or and ideological that you are, the more welcome and comfortable that you will find the politicization of science, as it reenforces your preconceptions.",5_2

On the apparent conspiracy to subvert peer review, it found that the ?allegations cannot be upheld??but, as the impressively even-handed Fred Pearce of the Guardian notes, this was partly on the grounds that ?the roles of CRU scientists and others could not be distinguished from those of colleagues.

"In lockstep with temperature, IPCC scientists needed to show a monotonic increase in CO2 such that the correlation with temperature was apparent at least since 1950/1960.So CO2 records have also been manipulated. One manipulation was the arbitrary changing of the age of the gas trapped in the upper part of an ice core, where the pressure changes were less drastic than in the deeper parts. In the upper part of the core, taken from Siple, Antarctica, the ice was deposited in the year 1890, and the CO2 concentrationin it was 328 ppmv (Friedli et al. 1986, Neftel et al.1985), and not the 290 ppmv needed to prove the man-madewarming hypothesis. The same CO2 concentration of 328ppmv was measured in the air collected directly from the atmosphere at the Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii, 83 years laterin 1973 (Boden et al. 1990). So, it was shockingly clear thatthe pre-industrial level of CO2 was the same as in the second half of the 20th Century.To solve this problem, these researchers simply made an ad hoc assumption: The age of the gas recovered from 1 to 10 grams of ice was arbitrarily decreed to be exactly 83 years younger than the ice in which it was trapped! This was notsupported by any experimental evidence, but only by assumptions which were in conflict with the facts (Jaworowski 1994a,Jaworowski et al. 1992b). The corrected proxy ice data were then smoothly aligned with the direct atmospheric measurements",5_2
"The main impression that I get from the emails is that the various scientists think that I and other requesters are simply doing this to harass them. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Those who are convinced that humans are wrecking the world by burning fossil fuels call those who dont believe them denialists. It implies that they are close to the Holocaust deniers, and so are clearly beyond the pale. I have come to the conclusion that they are wrong. The true denialists are those who believe in global warming, and who will go to any lengths to deny the evidence against that position.
